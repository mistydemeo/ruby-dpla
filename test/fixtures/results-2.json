                    "Colbert, Jan & Ann McMillan Harms. Dear Dr. King: Letters from Today's Children to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Illustrated by Ernest C. Withers & Roy Cajero. Hyperion, 1998. ISBN 0-7868-0417-3. $14.95. Unpaginated.” 3-6 PB NF Reviewed by Rachael W. Galvez After talking to their classes about Martin Luther King Jr., a group of Memphis, Tennessee teachers ask their students to write letters to Dr. King. The students ask questions, share feelings about King's life and death, give thanks for improvements in race relations, and express their desires for greater peace in the future. From the many letters generated in the project, a select group are interspersed in the book with historic photographs of King's time and pictures of today's children. Each letter is formatted uniquely by varying type size, font, color, and layout to create a book that is visually exciting. The letters range from affirmative to heartbreaking, as the children offer a personal evaluation about the ways in which King's dream has come true, as well as areas in which there is still much work to be done. For example, Scott, age 12, writes:” Today after my class went outside, we came in and we were allowed to drink from the same water fountain-all because of you. We got to work on the computers together-all because of you. We went to lunch together and sat at the same table and stood in the same line and ate the same lunches-all because of you. Thank you, Dr. King, you changed the world.” Erin, age 11, writes of another side of modern life:” If you were alive today you would go into shock. Some people are scared to go for a walk in their own neighborhoods. They are also scared because of drive-by shootings. Kids are also dropping out of school. They think school is not important. How else are they going to get a job somewhere else than Burger King? I wish you were here to help these people.” The power of this book is immeasurable, and it would be a very valuable part of any school or home study of Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights, race relations, or peace versus violence.",

                "description": [
                    "This work was supported primarily by the MRSEC Program of the National Science Foundation under DMR-0079996. Most studies in crystal plasticity are based upon Taylor's original 1938 work. Within Taylor's framework the dependence of yield strength on microstructure, beyond lattice orientation, is carried within the critical resolved shear stress for slip. Thus, as the grain size decreases, the critical resolved shear stress is required to increase. This increase in critical resolved shear stress is applied, uniformly across the entire interior of the slipping grains according to the basic assumption of the model (uniform plastic strain or strain rate). It is well known that slip patterns are not uniform over the grain interior. (If they were there would be negligible development of geometrically necessary dislocation content in the grain interior.) It is known, from the evidence of transmission electron microscopy, that certain microscopic conditions must exist near grain boundaries and triple junctions within polycrystalline materials, leading to differences in the patterns of dislocation slip near the boundaries, as compared with the grain interior. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework in which these microscopic conditions can be incorporated within the classical Taylor model. It will be shown how these considerations lead to a grain-size and grain-boundary-character dependence in the initial yield stress. The results are expressed in the Fourier space of microstructures.",
                    "EXTENDING TAYLOR PLASTICITY THEORY FOR MICROSCOPIC SLIP TRANSFER CONDITIONS B. L. Adams, B. S. El-Dasher*, R. Merrill, and J. Basinger Mechanical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA *Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA Abstract The main focus of the paper is an extension of the classical Taylor theory of plasticity to include the microscopic conditions for slip transfer at grain boundaries. It is demonstrated that such leads to consideration of the grain boundary character distribution function, in concert with the usual local state distribution function. The primary result is an expression for the generalized Taylor Factor that includes an inverse grain size dependence (Hall-Petch). 1. INTRODUCTION Most studies in crystal plasticity are based upon Taylor s original 1938 work.1 Within Taylor s framework the dependence of yield strength on microstructure, beyond lattice orientation, is carried within the critical resolved shear stress for slip. Thus, as the grain size decreases, the critical resolved shear stress is required to increase. This increase in critical resolved shear stress is applied, uniformly across the entire interior of the slipping grains according to the basic assumption of the model (uniform plastic strain or strain rate). It is well known that slip patterns are not uniform over the grain interior. (If they were there would be negligible development of geometrically necessary dislocation content in the grain interior.) It is known, from the evidence of transmission electron microscopy, that certain microscopic conditions must exist near grain boundaries and triple junctions within polycrystalline materials, leading to differences in the patterns of dislocation slip near the boundaries, as compared with the grain interior.2-4 The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework in which these microscopic conditions can be incorporated within the classical Taylor model. It will be shown how these considerations lead to a grain-size and grain-boundary-character dependence in the initial yield stress. The results are expressed in the Fourier space of microstructures. 2. BRIEF REVIEW OF TAYLOR PLASTICITY Let F denote the macroscopic plastic deformation gradient tensor. Our focus shall be on initial plastic yielding, and therefore F can be separated into I+ + , whereI is the second-order identity tensor, the infinitesimal strain and the infinitesimal rotation. Let F, and denote the local (crystallite) plastic deformation gradient, infinitesimal strain and infinitesimal rotation tensors, respectively. Taylor s theory assumes that all grains within the material will undergo the same shape change imposed upon a representative macroscopic sample of the material. Thus, = . (1) Crystal plastic strain can be accommodated by slip on any compatible set of slip systems, chosen from the set S. The deformation gradient associated with slip system s S is defined by it associated deformation gradient, strain and rotation tensors: F(s), (s), and (s), respectively. If b (s)represents the unit slip direction vector, and n (s) the unit slip plane normal direction vector associated with slip system s, and if (s) is the scalar slip strength, then F(s)=I+ (s) b (s) n (s), (s)=F(s)+F(s)T2 I, (s)=F(s) F(s)T2(2) where superscript T denotes the transpose and denotes the dyadic product. Whenever the slip strengths are sufficiently small ((s)<<1 for all s S) then to a good approximation F=I+(F(s) I) S , = (s) S , = (s) S , (3) where S S denotes the set of slip systems that have (s)>0. If c(s) is taken to be the operative critical resolved shear stress associated with slip system s, then the plastic work done is W: W= c(s) (s)s S . (4) The question naturally arises as to what are the possible sets, S , that satisfy the basic compatibility relation embodied in (1). Given that, to first order, the plastic strain tensor is volume conservative, and therefore tr() is zero, it follows that there will generally be five independent components of . Therefore, five slip systems, selected from among the set S, will be required to satisfy relation (1). Define S to be the set of all possible combinations of slip systems such that the compatibility relation is satisfied; thus, S= S | S S; (s)s S = . (5) Taylor then postulates that the particular operative set of slip systems is the set S that minimizes the plastic work. In mathematical terms S = S S W=min. (6) In cases where more than one set S satisfies the same minimum plastic work criterion, then the solution is ambiguous; such cases, however, will not be of further importance to that which follows. The so-called Taylor Factor (TF), , is defined to be a function of the unit strain, M(o) o, according to the relation : = : o= c(s) (s)s S = co (s) (s)s S = M(o) co. (7) Here the parameter scales the imposed strain to the unit strain: ; the coefficients = o (s) scale the critical resolved shear stress to the reference critical resolved shear stress, : co (s)= c(s) co; and denotes the Cauchy stress tensor. It is evident that the TF is dependent, not only upon the character of the imposed unit strain, o, but also upon the reference critical resolved shear stress, , the scaling coefficients, co (s), and the slip strain tensors, (s). The latter are clearly dependent upon the orientation of the crystal lattice in which b (s) n (s) is fixed; the former (scalar parameters) are dependent upon crystal phase, composition, and other local state parameters. Let h=h(,g,c,...) denote the complete set of local state parameters, including lattice phase and orientation g, chemical composition c, and any other pertinent parameters. Then . (8) M=M(h| o) The macroscopic TF, M o, is obtained by averaging the local Taylor factors, , over the representative volume of the sample. If the volume fraction distribution of the local state is defined by ()M(h| o) dV/V=f(h)dh, (9) where dh is the appropriate invariant measure on local state space5, then M (o)=f(h)M(h| o)dhH , (10) where H denotes the complete local state space. Let Tlr (h) represent the complete set of orthogonal basis functions for the set of real-valued, square-integrable functions of the form F:H . Also, define the Fourier representation of the local state function be f(h)= Flr Tlr (h)all ,l,r, , , (11) and the local TF to be M(h| o)= mlr (o) Tlr (h)all ,l,r, , . (12) It follows that relation (10) can be expressed, in terms of the Fourier coefficients that define the local state distribution function, Flr , and the coefficients that define the local Taylor Factor, mlr (o), by the expression M (o)= m lr (o) Flr all ,l,r, , , (13) where m lr (o)= l mlr (o). Further details on the Fourier description are given in the works of Bunge.5 It is known that relatively small numbers of the coefficients mlr (o) are required for convergence in relation (12), and hence the number of coefficients of the microstructure that are important in (13) is also similarly limited.6 3. EXTENSIONS OF TAYLOR PLASTICITY TO INCLUDE MICROSCOPIC CONDITIONS 3.1 Experimental Evidence Figure 1. Typical orientation boundary layer in 30% plastically-deformed <001> aluminum. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental evidence for the modifications to Taylor s fully constrained theory. The sample consists of <001> directionally solidified aluminum, deformed plastically in compression to 0.30 height reduction. The starting grain size of the material is 5 millimeters. Using fine-scale orientation imaging microscopy7, the orientation field of material adjacent grain boundaries is observed. The step size of the scan is 0.5 microns. Lattice orientation is determined at each step point, to within . In Figure 1 all scan points that lie with of the average orientation in the near boundary zone are shaded black. It is evident that a boundary layer develops adjacent the grain boundaries; and this boundary layer has a distinct orientation compared to that found in the grain interior. The two regions are separated by a system of geometrically necessary dislocations. 0.5o2.5o 3.2 Modified Taylor Theory with Microscopic Conditions Transmission electron microscopy suggests that certain microscopic conditions favor dislocation slip transmission across grain boundaries.2-4 These include: a) a minimum of residual net burgers vector is left behind in the grain boundary, b) the shear stress ahead of a slip system pileup, resolved in the adjacent grain, is maximized, and c) the angle of intersection between two adjacent slip systems in the grain boundary plane is minimized. Here we maintain the basic compatibility requirement that pertains to Taylor s theory, embodied in relation (1). We shall relax, in the vicinity of the grain boundary, however, the minimum plastic work hypothesis of Taylor, embodied in relation (6). In its place we postulate the existence of a microscopic condition that governs the slip patterns near the grain boundary. Let a local element of the grain boundary have unit normal vector . Let it separate grain A and grain B. Let n hA and hB denote the local state of grain A and B. We suppose that the nominal thickness of the grain boundary layer is a in grain A and b in grain B. We shall assume that it is only in these regions that Taylor s minimum plastic work criterion must be altered. Let SA denote the set of all possible slip system combinations that satisfy relation (1) in grain A. Similarly, let SB denote the set of all possible slip system combinations that satisfy relation (1) in grain B. Following the notational conventions of the previous section, let SA and SB represent the patterns of slip in grains A and B that satisfy the minimum plastic work criterion of Taylor. The associated TFs shall be M(hA| o)and M(hB| o). Next, consider the boundary layers associated with grains A and B. It is evident from the experimental observations that the slip pattern in the boundary layer in grain A is dependent upon the slip pattern in the boundary layer in grain B, and vice-versa. Without being more specific as to the exact nature of this dependence, let SA denote the correct slip pattern in grain A in the boundary layer of thickness a, after due consideration for the pertinent microscopic condition. Similarly, let SB be the associated slip pattern in B within the boundary layer of thickness b. Also, let M(hA| n ,hB, o)S be the TF in the boundary layer of grain A, associated with slip pattern A ; and let M(hB| n ,hA, o) represent the TF in the boundary layer of grain B, associated with slip pattern SB . Also, since it is known that M(hA| n ,hB, o) M(hA| o), M(hB| n ,hA, o) M(hB| o), (14) it is useful to define the Excess TF, M, in the following way: M(hA| n ,hB, o)=M(hA| n ,hB, o) M(hA| o), M(hB| n ,hA, o)=M(hB| n ,hA, o) M(hB| o) (15) The new macroscopic TF, M (o) now contains two terms: M (o)=M (o)+ M (o), (16) where M (o) is the original TF, defined via the local state distribution function through relation (10), and M is defined by (o) M (o)=12SV(hA, n ,hB)a M(hA| n ,hB, o)+b M(hB| n ,hA, o) H S2 H dhAd n dhB,(17) where SV(hA, n ,hB) is the grain boundary character distribution function.8 In relation (17) the integration is over the space of possible grain boundary characters, H S2 H , where character is defined by local state hA H on side A of the grain boundary, unit normal n S2 defining the inclination of the boundary plane when passing from side A to side B, and local state hB H on side B. Only in homophase materials will H= H . (Additional details about this product space have been reviewed in Adams and Olson.9) The reader should note that SV(hA, n ,hB)dhAd n dhB is equal to the surface area per unit volume of grain boundary that has local state lying in the range dhA of hA on side A of the boundary, normal direction lying in the range d n of direction , and local state lying in the range n dhB of hB on side B. When multiplied by the Excess TFs, weighted by their thicknesses, contained in the term [ ] in equation (17), we obtain an approximation for the additional plastic work done due to relaxation of Taylor s minimum plastic work criterion to accommodate a local microscopic criterion. The approximation is valid if a, where d is the grain size of the material. ,b<<d Note that the dimension of the grain boundary character function is , and therefore the grain boundary term in the Excess TF, , is also inversely proportional to the grain size of the microstructure. The remainder of its functional dependence is found in the distribution of grain boundary character types within the microstructure. d 1 M (o) Constructing a complete orthogonal system of basis functions on H S2 H is achieved with products of the eigenfunctions defined on each separate space.9 Thus, the Excess TF accepts a Fourier representation of the form M(hA| n ,hB, o)= p qml l r r (o) Tlr (hA)all , ,l, l ,r, r , , , , kpq(n) T l r (hB) (18) where are the surface spherical harmonic functions. A similar Fourier representation exists for the grain boundary character distribution function, with coefficients kpq(n)p qGl l r r . Thus, an expression like (13) for is M (o) M (o)= p q m l l r r (o)p qGl l r r all , ,l, l ,r, r , , , , , (19) where p q m l l r r = l l p qml l r r . 3.3 Exemplary Microscopic Conditions Next, consider an example of how certain elements of the microscopic conditions can be implemented. We shall consider only criterion a), minimum net Burger s vector in the grain boundary. Let n denote the normal to the grain boundary. The net density of Burger s vector left behind in the grain boundary is just r b GB= (s) b (s) n () b (s) (s) b (s) n () b (s) S A S B . (20) In accordance with microscopic condition a) we shall select S A, S B so that r b GB=min. These will be considered to be the operative sets. Consider the three independent 101 0{}112 0 slip systems in hexagonal crystals. Restrict consideration to 0001 columnar polycrystals. For this case the orientation distribution function is simply defined over the angular interval 0, 3[) of rotations about 0001. Figure 2 shows the Excess TF calculated from the minimum residual Burger s vector criterion, where A, B describe the orientations of grains A, B relative to a common reference frame. For this calculation, is the only non-zero component of plastic strain, and lies in the 11o=10001() plane. (The symmetry about A= B is a consequence of the homophase nature of the boundary, and setting a=b. The value of the Excess TF is precisely zero on this line.) Evidently, the Excess TF is a complex function of macroscopic grain boundary parameters. Figure 2. Excess Taylor Factor as a function of orientation parameters A, B (radians). 4. Discussion and Conclusions We conclude that the incorporation of any of the observed microscopic conditions for slip transfer at grain boundaries, within the classical Taylor theory of plasticity, gives rise to an inverse grain size dependence of the Excess TF. All eight macroscopic parameters of grain boundary character associated with the grain boundary character distribution function are also predicted to affect the Excess TF. It is evident that the uniform strain criterion of Taylor enforces rather restrictive requirements on plastic deformation, and these will often violate local conditions of stress equilibrium. However, within the Taylor framework it will be important to examine the details of the geometrically-necessary dislocations that are observed to form at the transition region between the boundary layers shown in Figure 1, and the grain interior region. Such considerations may provide sensitive insight into the most appropriate microscopic conditions to apply in conjunction with the Taylor theory. 5.

Our focus shall be on initial plastic yielding, and therefore F can be separated into I+ + , whereI is the second-order identity tensor, the infinitesimal strain and the infinitesimal rotation. Let F, and denote the local (crystallite) plastic deformation gradient, infinitesimal strain and infinitesimal rotation tensors, respectively. Taylor s theory assumes that all grains within the material will undergo the same shape change imposed upon a representative macroscopic sample of the material. Thus, = . (1) Crystal plastic strain can be accommodated by slip on any compatible set of slip systems, chosen from the set S. The deformation gradient associated with slip system s S is defined by it associated deformation gradient, strain and rotation tensors: F(s), (s), and (s), respectively. If b (s)represents the unit slip direction vector, and n (s) the unit slip plane normal direction vector associated with slip system s, and if (s) is the scalar slip strength, then F(s)=I+ (s) b (s) n (s), (s)=F(s)+F(s)T2 I, (s)=F(s) F(s)T2(2) where superscript T denotes the transpose and denotes the dyadic product. Whenever the slip strengths are sufficiently small ( (s)<<1 for all s S) then to a good approximation F=I+(F(s) I) S , = (s) S , = (s) S , (3) where S S denotes the set of slip systems that have (s)>0. If c(s) is taken to be the operative critical resolved shear stress associated with slip system s, then the plastic work done is W: W= c(s) (s)s S . (4) The question naturally arises as to what are the possible sets, S , that satisfy the basic compatibility relation embodied in (1). Given that, to first order, the plastic strain tensor is volume conservative, and therefore tr( ) is zero, it follows that there will generally be five independent components of . Therefore, five slip systems, selected from among the set S, will be required to satisfy relation (1). Define S to be the set of all possible combinations of slip systems such that the compatibility relation is satisfied; thus, S= S | S S; (s)s S = . (5) Taylor then postulates that the particular operative set of slip systems is the set S that minimizes the plastic work. In mathematical terms S = S S W=min. (6) In cases where more than one set S satisfies the same minimum plastic work criterion, then the solution is ambiguous; such cases, however, will not be of further importance to that which follows. The so-called Taylor Factor (TF), , is defined to be a function of the unit strain, M( o) o, according to the relation : = : o= c(s) (s)s S = co (s) (s)s S = M( o) co. (7) Here the parameter scales the imposed strain to the unit strain: ; the coefficients = o (s) scale the critical resolved shear stress to the reference critical resolved shear stress, : co (s)= c(s) co; and denotes the Cauchy stress tensor. It is evident that the TF is dependent, not only upon the character of the imposed unit strain, o, but also upon the reference critical resolved shear stress, , the scaling coefficients, co (s), and the slip strain tensors, (s). The latter are clearly dependent upon the orientation of the crystal lattice in which b (s) n (s) is fixed; the former (scalar parameters) are dependent upon crystal phase, composition, and other local state parameters. Let h=h( ,g,c,...) denote the complete set of local state parameters, including lattice phase and orientation g, chemical composition c, and any other pertinent parameters. Then . (8) M=M(h| o) The macroscopic TF, M o, is obtained by averaging the local Taylor factors, , over the representative volume of the sample. If the volume fraction distribution of the local state is defined by ()M(h| o) dV/V=f(h)dh, (9) where dh is the appropriate invariant measure on local state space5, then M ( o)=f(h)M(h| o)dhH , (10) where H denotes the complete local state space. Let Tlr (h) represent the complete set of orthogonal basis functions for the set of real-valued, square-integrable functions of the form F:H . Also, define the Fourier representation of the local state function be f(h)= Flr Tlr (h)all ,l,r, , , (11) and the local TF to be M(h| o)= mlr ( o) Tlr (h)all ,l,r, , . (12) It follows that relation (10) can be expressed, in terms of the Fourier coefficients that define the local state distribution function, Flr , and the coefficients that define the local Taylor Factor, mlr ( o), by the expression M ( o)= m lr ( o) Flr all ,l,r, , , (13) where m lr ( o)= l mlr ( o). Further details on the Fourier description are given in the works of Bunge.5 It is known that relatively small numbers of the coefficients mlr ( o) are required for convergence in relation (12), and hence the number of coefficients of the microstructure that are important in (13) is also similarly limited.6 3. EXTENSIONS OF TAYLOR PLASTICITY TO INCLUDE MICROSCOPIC CONDITIONS 3.1 Experimental Evidence Figure 1. Typical orientation boundary layer in 30% plastically-deformed <001> aluminum. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental evidence for the modifications to Taylor s fully constrained theory. The sample consists of <001> directionally solidified aluminum, deformed plastically in compression to 0.30 height reduction. The starting grain size of the material is 5 millimeters. Using fine-scale orientation imaging microscopy7, the orientation field of material adjacent grain boundaries is observed. The step size of the scan is 0.5 microns. Lattice orientation is determined at each step point, to within . In Figure 1 all scan points that lie with of the average orientation in the near boundary zone are shaded black. It is evident that a boundary layer develops adjacent the grain boundaries; and this boundary layer has a distinct orientation compared to that found in the grain interior. The two regions are separated by a system of geometrically necessary dislocations. 0.5o2.5o 3.2 Modified Taylor Theory with Microscopic Conditions Transmission electron microscopy suggests that certain microscopic conditions favor dislocation slip transmission across grain boundaries.2-4 These include: a) a minimum of residual net burgers vector is left behind in the grain boundary, b) the shear stress ahead of a slip system pileup, resolved in the adjacent grain, is maximized, and c) the angle of intersection between two adjacent slip systems in the grain boundary plane is minimized. Here we maintain the basic compatibility requirement that pertains to Taylor s theory, embodied in relation (1). We shall relax, in the vicinity of the grain boundary, however, the minimum plastic work hypothesis of Taylor, embodied in relation (6). In its place we postulate the existence of a microscopic condition that governs the slip patterns near the grain boundary. Let a local element of the grain boundary have unit normal vector . Let it separate grain A and grain B. Let n hA and hB denote the local state of grain A and B. We suppose that the nominal thickness of the grain boundary layer is a in grain A and b in grain B. We shall assume that it is only in these regions that Taylor s minimum plastic work criterion must be altered. Let SA denote the set of all possible slip system combinations that satisfy relation (1) in grain A. Similarly, let SB denote the set of all possible slip system combinations that satisfy relation (1) in grain B. Following the notational conventions of the previous section, let SA and SB represent the patterns of slip in grains A and B that satisfy the minimum plastic work criterion of Taylor. The associated TFs shall be M(hA| o)and M(hB| o). Next, consider the boundary layers associated with grains A and B. It is evident from the experimental observations that the slip pattern in the boundary layer in grain A is dependent upon the slip pattern in the boundary layer in grain B, and vice-versa. Without being more specific as to the exact nature of this dependence, let SA denote the correct slip pattern in grain A in the boundary layer of thickness a, after due consideration for the pertinent microscopic condition. Similarly, let SB be the associated slip pattern in B within the boundary layer of thickness b. Also, let M(hA| n ,hB, o)S be the TF in the boundary layer of grain A, associated with slip pattern A ; and let M(hB| n ,hA, o) represent the TF in the boundary layer of grain B, associated with slip pattern SB . Also, since it is known that M(hA| n ,hB, o) M(hA| o), M(hB| n ,hA, o) M(hB| o), (14) it is useful to define the Excess TF, M, in the following way: M(hA| n ,hB, o)=M(hA| n ,hB, o) M(hA| o), M(hB| n ,hA, o)=M(hB| n ,hA, o) M(hB| o) (15) The new macroscopic TF, M ( o) now contains two terms: M ( o)=M ( o)+ M ( o), (16) where M ( o) is the original TF, defined via the local state distribution function through relation (10), and M is defined by ( o) M ( o)=12SV(hA, n ,hB)a M(hA| n ,hB, o)+b M(hB| n ,hA, o) H S2 H dhAd n dhB,(17) where SV(hA, n ,hB) is the grain boundary character distribution function.8 In relation (17) the integration is over the space of possible grain boundary characters, H S2 H , where character is defined by local state hA H on side A of the grain boundary, unit normal n S2 defining the inclination of the boundary plane when passing from side A to side B, and local state hB H on side B. Only in homophase materials will H= H . (Additional details about this product space have been reviewed in Adams and Olson.9) The reader should note that SV(hA, n ,hB)dhAd n dhB is equal to the surface area per unit volume of grain boundary that has local state lying in the range dhA of hA on side A of the boundary, normal direction lying in the range d n of direction , and local state lying in the range n dhB of hB on side B. When multiplied by the Excess TFs, weighted by their thicknesses, contained in the term [ ] in equation (17), we obtain an approximation for the additional plastic work done due to relaxation of Taylor s minimum plastic work criterion to accommodate a local microscopic criterion. The approximation is valid if a, where d is the grain size of the material. ,b<<d Note that the dimension of the grain boundary character function is , and therefore the grain boundary term in the Excess TF, , is also inversely proportional to the grain size of the microstructure. The remainder of its functional dependence is found in the distribution of grain boundary character types within the microstructure. d 1 M ( o) Constructing a complete orthogonal system of basis functions on H S2 H is achieved with products of the eigenfunctions defined on each separate space.9 Thus, the Excess TF accepts a Fourier representation of the form M(hA| n ,hB, o)= p qml l r r ( o) Tlr (hA)all , ,l, l ,r, r , , , , kpq( n ) T l r (hB) (18) where are the surface spherical harmonic functions. A similar Fourier representation exists for the grain boundary character distribution function, with coefficients kpq( n )p qGl l r r . Thus, an expression like (13) for is M ( o) M ( o)= p q m l l r r ( o)p qGl l r r all , ,l, l ,r, r , , , , , (19) where p q m l l r r = l l p qml l r r . 3.3 Exemplary Microscopic Conditions Next, consider an example of how certain elements of the microscopic conditions can be implemented. We shall consider only criterion a), minimum net Burger s vector in the grain boundary. Let n denote the normal to the grain boundary. The net density of Burger s vector left behind in the grain boundary is just r b GB= (s) b (s) n () b (s) (s) b (s) n () b (s) S A S B . (20) In accordance with microscopic condition a) we shall select S A, S B so that r b GB=min. These will be considered to be the operative sets. Consider the three independent 101 0{}112 0 slip systems in hexagonal crystals. Restrict consideration to 0001 columnar polycrystals. For this case the orientation distribution function is simply defined over the angular interval 0, 3[ ) of rotations about 0001. Figure 2 shows the Excess TF calculated from the minimum residual Burger s vector criterion, where A, B describe the orientations of grains A, B relative to a common reference frame. For this calculation, is the only non-zero component of plastic strain, and lies in the 11o=10001() plane. (The symmetry about A= B is a consequence of the homophase nature of the boundary, and setting a=b. The value of the Excess TF is precisely zero on this line.) Evidently, the Excess TF is a complex function of macroscopic grain boundary parameters. Figure 2. Excess Taylor Factor as a function of orientation parameters A, B (radians). 4. Discussion and Conclusions We conclude that the incorporation of any of the observed microscopic conditions for slip transfer at grain boundaries, within the classical Taylor theory of plasticity, gives rise to an inverse grain size dependence of the Excess TF. All eight macroscopic parameters of grain boundary character associated with the grain boundary character distribution function are also predicted to affect the Excess TF. It is evident that the uniform strain criterion of Taylor enforces rather restrictive requirements on plastic deformation, and these will often violate local conditions of stress equilibrium. However, within the Taylor framework it will be important to examine the details of the geometrically-necessary dislocations that are observed to form at the transition region between the boundary layers shown in Figure 1, and the grain interior region. Such considerations may provide sensitive insight into the most appropriate microscopic conditions to apply in conjunction with the Taylor theory. 5.

                    "Google Scholar (GS) was released as a beta product in November of 2004. Since then, GS has been scrutinized and questioned by many in academia and the library field. Our objectives in undertaking this study were to determine how scholarly GS is in comparison with traditional library resources and to determine if the scholarliness of materials found in GS varies across disciplines. We found that GS is, on average, 17.6% more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there is no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in GS across disciplines.",
                    "How Scholarly is ? A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland | Thomas C. Wright | Rebecca A. Boughan | Brian C. Roberts Brigham Young Univeristy Tuesday, July 8, 2008 1 Introduction Literature Review Tuesday, July 8, 2008 2 Tuesday, July 8, 2008 3 Methodology Subject specialists Tuesday, July 8, 2008 4 7 Subject specialists from 3 disciplines: 3 from sciences 2 from humanities 2 from social sciences Blind to purpose of study Asked them to give us 3 things... How does the acquisition and use of a second language in children affect their general cognitive development? Tuesday, July 8, 2008 5 A question they would typically receive from a student (humanities) (bilingual* OR L2) AND (child* OR toddler) AND cognitive development Tuesday, July 8, 2008 6 A structured query they would use to search a database Linguistic and Language Behavior Abstracts Tuesday, July 8, 2008 7 The database they would use to search for that question Academic Discipline Database Query Library Database Science (ACL or anterior cruciate ligament*) and injur* and (athlet* or sport or sports) and (therap* or treat* or rehab*) SportDiscus Science lung cancer and (etiol* or caus*) and (cigarette* or smok* or nicotine*) Medline Science dark matter and evidence Applied Science and Technology Abstracts Social Science (fast food or mcdonald s or wendy s or burger king or restaurant) and franchis* and (knowledge n3 transfer or knowledge management or train*) Business Source Premier Social Science (standardized test* or high stakes test*) and (learning disabilit* or Dyslexia or learning problem) and accommodat* PsycINFO Humanities (bilingual* or L2) and (child* or toddler) and cognitive development Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts Humanities (memor* or remembrance or memoir*) and (holocaust) and (Spiegelman or Maus) JSTOR Tuesday, July 8, 2008 8 This is what things looked like after we got all the information back from the librarians Methodology Search using query Tuesday, July 8, 2008 9 Then we took that information and used it in 2 ways. Native database results Tuesday, July 8, 2008 10 The first was to actually run the search query in the suggested database. We put the first 30 citations into a bibliographic citation manager and saved all of the actual full text We chose 30 because usability studies (Jakob Neilsen) tell us that less than 1% of all users ever go beyond the 3rd page of results and very few people ever change the defaults (ie, once they run a search they stick with it, success or failure). Most of our DBs present 10 results per page so 30 results should represent a large enough sample to represent the actual set of results the majority of our users is ever going to see after performing a search. Google Scholar results Tuesday, July 8, 2008 11 We ran the same query in Google Scholar and saved the results again in a bibliographic Manager. We used Zotero to quickly export all of the results. We also saved the full text of each citation for later use in our study. Methodology Search using citations Tuesday, July 8, 2008 12 So, the first searches we ran using the native DBs and GS was for the query given to us by the librarian The second set of searches we ran was to see if the citations we found in the DB were available in GS and vice versa Is this citation available in Google Scholar? Tuesday, July 8, 2008 13 Here is the same screenshot we saw just a minute ago. We took the bibliographic information for each citation and searched for the citation within Google Scholar. Yes, it is available Tuesday, July 8, 2008 14 We then did the same thing in reverse. We took the 30 results from GS and searched for each citation within the database in GS in in both DB Exclusivity Tuesday, July 8, 2008 15 This allowed us to later calculate something we called exclusivity We put the citations into 1 of 3 possible exclusivity categories Shows proportion of citations within our study that overlap. As you can see, within our study we found that, on average, GS had a larger result set overall as well as more exclusively than the databases. Methodology Citation grading Tuesday, July 8, 2008 16 So now that we have the citations from the database and the citations from Google Scholar. We used the bibliographic manager to generate a list of references that we input into an Excel spreadsheet. Then, using a random number table, we completely randomized the order of the citations for each subject specialist. Tuesday, July 8, 2008 17 Finally, to deliver the content to the librarians in a way in which it would be easiest for them to evaluate, we saved the full-text of each citation according to its randomly assigned citation number. Then we used Excel to create hyperlinks to the full-text of each citation and delivered this list along with the full-text on a CD to the subject librarians. We asked them to evaluate each citation using a rubric which we provided in hard copy form. As you can see, the subject librarians were only able to see the citation number and the bibliographic information.

It is based on a rubric that has popularly been used to evaluate print resources (Alexander, 1999) Alexander, J. E. (1999). Web wisdom: How to evaluate and create information quality on the Web. We asked each subject librarian to assign a score of between 1 and 3 within 6 different categories to each of the citations (1 was below average, 2 was average and 3 was above average). These six categories were: Accuracy which looks at Authority specifically the Objectivity looking for Currency is the information up to date? How deep is the Coverage And finally Relevancy how well does the citation relate to the research question This resulted in a total possible score of 18 for each citation - we called this a scholarliness score Methodology total scholarliness score = + Ei + Lj + ELij + ijkl where = Average total score E = Effect due to exclusivity (i = 1, 2, 3) L = Effect due to librarian (j = 1, 2, ... 7) EL = Interaction between exclusivity and librarian = Error term Tuesday, July 8, 2008 19 We used this statistical model to evaluate the data. Essentially this formula says 2 important things about the way we used the data: 1. We controlled for the differences between the way librarians grade 2. We controlled for the differences in how exclusively the citation was available This allowed us to pinpoint and measure any differences there may have been between disciplines in our data as well as any differences that can be attributed to the source of the citations Results Google Scholar was 17.6% more scholarly Tuesday, July 8, 2008 20 Citations found only in GS had, on average, a 17.6% higher scholarliness score than citations found only in the DB Results Highest scholarliness score when found in both Tuesday, July 8, 2008 21 Citations found in both GS and the DB were even higher than citations found only in GS Results No difference between disciplines Tuesday, July 8, 2008 22 We found no statistically significant difference in the scholarliness scores between disciplines (ie, humanities citations in GS are just as scholarly as science citations found in GS) 0 9 18 AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 14.3 13.9 11.5 14.3 15.6 14.6 13.5 14.2 14.4 11.6 12.8 13.5 12.0 13.8 16.1 14.0 11.9 11.7 13.2 10.0 10.0 11.7 16.5 Average Scholarliness Score Only in database Only in GS In both Tuesday, July 8, 2008 23 0% 50% 100% AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 47% 43% 97% 80% 28% 47% 35% 82% 100% 97% 93% 83% 76% 77% database citations in GS GS citations in database Tuesday, July 8, 2008 24 Future Studies Generally applicable results Tuesday, July 8, 2008 25 This study can only be extrapolated statistically to the specific topics and subject specialists used in this study A more robust statistical methodology would need to be employed to make these results generally applicable We are encouraged by the results we received and feel that they would probably hold up but cannot say so until another study is done Future Studies Improved rubric Tuesday, July 8, 2008 26 If we had to do it over again, we would have increased the Likert scale on our rubric from 1-3 to 1-7 or 1-10 This would have allowed for a more nuanced statistical analysis and made it easier to spot significant differences, if any, between GS and databases Future Studies Scholarliness calculation Tuesday, July 8, 2008 27 Our scholarliness calculation, ultimately, was based on the subjective opinions of librarians with subject expertise. There are lots of ways to create a scholarliness score (citation counts, impact factors, etc).

A more appropriate comparison may be GS to federated search tools.

                                "Google Scholar (GS) was released as a beta product in November of 2004. Since then, GS has been scrutinized and questioned by many in academia and the library field. Our objectives in undertaking this study were to determine how scholarly GS is in comparison with traditional library resources and to determine if the scholarliness of materials found in GS varies across disciplines. We found that GS is, on average, 17.6% more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there is no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in GS across disciplines.",
                                "How Scholarly is ? A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland | Thomas C. Wright | Rebecca A. Boughan | Brian C. Roberts Brigham Young Univeristy Tuesday, July 8, 2008 1 Introduction Literature Review Tuesday, July 8, 2008 2 Tuesday, July 8, 2008 3 Methodology Subject specialists Tuesday, July 8, 2008 4 7 Subject specialists from 3 disciplines: 3 from sciences 2 from humanities 2 from social sciences Blind to purpose of study Asked them to give us 3 things... How does the acquisition and use of a second language in children affect their general cognitive development? Tuesday, July 8, 2008 5 A question they would typically receive from a student (humanities) (bilingual* OR L2) AND (child* OR toddler) AND cognitive development Tuesday, July 8, 2008 6 A structured query they would use to search a database Linguistic and Language Behavior Abstracts Tuesday, July 8, 2008 7 The database they would use to search for that question Academic Discipline Database Query Library Database Science (ACL or anterior cruciate ligament* ) and injur* and (athlet* or sport or sports) and (therap* or treat* or rehab*) SportDiscus Science lung cancer and (etiol* or caus*) and (cigarette* or smok* or nicotine*) Medline Science dark matter and evidence Applied Science and Technology Abstracts Social Science ( fast food or mcdonald s or wendy s or burger king or restaurant) and franchis* and (knowledge n3 transfer or knowledge management or train*) Business Source Premier Social Science ( standardized test* or high stakes test* ) and ( learning disabilit* or Dyslexia or learning problem ) and accommodat* PsycINFO Humanities (bilingual* or L2) and (child* or toddler) and cognitive development Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts Humanities (memor* or remembrance or memoir*) and (holocaust) and (Spiegelman or Maus) JSTOR Tuesday, July 8, 2008 8 This is what things looked like after we got all the information back from the librarians Methodology Search using query Tuesday, July 8, 2008 9 Then we took that information and used it in 2 ways. Native database results Tuesday, July 8, 2008 10 The first was to actually run the search query in the suggested database. We put the first 30 citations into a bibliographic citation manager and saved all of the actual full text We chose 30 because usability studies (Jakob Neilsen) tell us that less than 1% of all users ever go beyond the 3rd page of results and very few people ever change the defaults (ie, once they run a search they stick with it, success or failure). Most of our DBs present 10 results per page so 30 results should represent a large enough sample to represent the actual set of results the majority of our users is ever going to see after performing a search. Google Scholar results Tuesday, July 8, 2008 11 We ran the same query in Google Scholar and saved the results again in a bibliographic Manager. We used Zotero to quickly export all of the results. We also saved the full text of each citation for later use in our study. Methodology Search using citations Tuesday, July 8, 2008 12 So, the first searches we ran using the native DBs and GS was for the query given to us by the librarian The second set of searches we ran was to see if the citations we found in the DB were available in GS and vice versa Is this citation available in Google Scholar? Tuesday, July 8, 2008 13 Here is the same screenshot we saw just a minute ago. We took the bibliographic information for each citation and searched for the citation within Google Scholar. Yes, it is available Tuesday, July 8, 2008 14 We then did the same thing in reverse. We took the 30 results from GS and searched for each citation within the database in GS in in both DB Exclusivity Tuesday, July 8, 2008 15 This allowed us to later calculate something we called exclusivity We put the citations into 1 of 3 possible exclusivity categories Shows proportion of citations within our study that overlap. As you can see, within our study we found that, on average, GS had a larger result set overall as well as more exclusively than the databases. Methodology Citation grading Tuesday, July 8, 2008 16 So now that we have the citations from the database and the citations from Google Scholar. We used the bibliographic manager to generate a list of references that we input into an Excel spreadsheet. Then, using a random number table, we completely randomized the order of the citations for each subject specialist. Tuesday, July 8, 2008 17 Finally, to deliver the content to the librarians in a way in which it would be easiest for them to evaluate, we saved the full-text of each citation according to its randomly assigned citation number. Then we used Excel to create hyperlinks to the full-text of each citation and delivered this list along with the full-text on a CD to the subject librarians. We asked them to evaluate each citation using a rubric which we provided in hard copy form. As you can see, the subject librarians were only able to see the citation number and the bibliographic information. By clicking on the hyperlinked citation number, the full-text of that citation would appear and the subject librarians could easily rate the citation on the rubric.

A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan, and Brian C. Roberts May 21, 2008 Abstract Google Scholar (GS) was released as a beta product in November of 2004. Since then, GS has been scrutinized and questioned by many in academia and the library field. Our objectives in undertaking this study were to determine how scholarly GS is in comparison with traditional library resources and to determine if the scholarliness of materials found in GS varies across disciplines. We found that GS is, on average, 17.6% more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there is no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in GS across disciplines. Introduction Google Scholar (GS) was introduced to the world in November of 2004 as a beta product. It has been embraced by students, scholars, and librarians alike. However, GS has received criticism regarding the breadth and scope of available content. We undertook this study to answer two questions regarding these common criticisms: (1) Are GS result sets more or less scholarly than licensed library database result sets? and (2) Does the scholarliness of GS vary across disciplines? Literature Review GS, which is still branded as a beta version, has not only become a common fixture in library literature but is also becoming ubiquitous in information-seeking behavior of users. GS was initially met with curiosity and skepticism [1-3]. This was followed by a period of systematic study [4-7]. More recently, there has been optimism about GS s potential to move us towards Kilgour s goal of 100% availability of information [8]. Librarians find themselves reluctantly acknowledging users preferences for one-stop information shopping by giving GS ever-increasing visibility on their web pages [9]. Even as they begrudgingly promote GS, the debate continues within the information community as to the advisability of guiding users to this tool. The view of critics like P ter Jasc [10-12], who use terms such as shallowness and artificial unintelligence to describe the program, seems to be giving way to a landscape where respected publishers (e.g., Cambridge) and platforms (e.g., JSTOR) are now offering links out to GS for more citations. Early studies of GS tried to match citations hit to hit in comparison with traditional academic search engines. Jasc even provided a web site where the curious could compare search results between GS and the likes of Nature, Wiley or Blackwell [13]. More recently, studies have appeared that track the value-added open access citations that appear uniquely in How Scholarly Is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 2 GS versus other sources [14]. However, is comprehensiveness of content the primary indicator of a resource s usefulness? Every title from every database may not be in GS, but that should not be an indictment of GS s inability to return scholarly results across disciplines. The algorithms GS uses to return result sets cannot really be compared to library database algorithms. However, what is returned can be judged for its relevancy and scholarliness. Up to this point, studies of GS have followed the example of Neuhaus et al. (2006), which compared GS content to forty-seven other databases. This title-by-title and citation-by-citation comparison is a pure numerical measure but neglects to address the efficacy of any particular search or the scholarly nature of content or algorithms in discovering that content. We felt that a different approach was needed. Rather than measuring what has gone into the database, we have sought, to some degree, to evaluate what comes out as a result of search queries. We have done this by involving subject librarians with knowledge of typical reference questions and using those questions to query both GS and discipline-specific databases. We then asked the same librarians to judge the search results using a rubric of scholarliness. This notion of scholarliness utilizes a common collection-assessment tool as outlined by Alexander [15]. This model considers many factors, including accuracy, authority, objectivity, currency, and coverage. In this way we have attempted to inject a qualitative value of GS results to the ongoing debate. Methodology We selected seven subject librarians from various academic disciplines, humanities, science and social science. Each specialist was blind to the purpose of the study. We requested that they provide us (1) a sample question that they typically receive from students, (2) a structured query to search a library database, and (3) the library database they would use for that particular query. [INSERT TABLE 1] We then used their data in two different ways. First, we translated the library database query into an equivalent search string used by GS. Using the original query and the query translated to work with GS, we searched both the library database and GS and retrieved the citations and full text for the first thirty results. We selected thirty results because research has shown that less than one percent of all users ever go to a third page of results and most search engines return about ten results per page [16]. Next, we took the citations from the library databases and determined if they could also be found using GS and took the citations from GS to see if they could also be found in the library database. This allowed us to calculate the overlap of citations between the library databases and GS. We standardized the formatting of the citations and inserted them randomly into a spreadsheet, which contained a rubric that was used to assign a scholarliness score to each of the citations. The rubric contained six criteria, based on Alexander s (1999) model of evaluating resources, to judge scholarliness: (1) accuracy, (2) authority, (3) objectivity, (4) currency, (5) coverage, and (6) relevancy. These criteria were graded on a scale of 1 (below average) to 3 (above average) and summed to create a total scholarliness score for each citation. [INSERT TABLE 2] We provided the subject librarians with the full text of each of the citations and asked them to use the rubric to evaluate the scholarliness of the individual citations. After the grading was completed, we were able to group each citation from the subject librarian into one of three How Scholarly is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 3 categories: (1) the citation was available only in the library database, (2) the citation was available only in GS, or (3) the citation was available in both the library database and GS. We have used the term exclusivity to describe the three categories. Once we had grouped the citations by category, we ran a statistical analysis that controlled for the effect of the individual librarian on the total scholarliness score, for the effect of exclusivity , and for any interaction there may have been between both librarian and exclusivity : total scholarliness score = + Ei + Lj + ELij + ijkl Where: = Average total score E = Effect due to exclusivity (i = 1, 2, 3) L = Effect due to librarian (j = 1, 2, . . . 7) EL = Interaction between exclusivity and librarian = Error term Within the context of this formula, E controls for any effect due to the exclusivity of the citation, where i represents each of the three categories of exclusivity (i.e., the citation was found only in the database, it was found only in GS, or it was found in both the database and GS). Each librarian (L) also played a role in the total scholarliness score. One librarian could have provided consistently low scores with another having a tendency toward higher scores. To account for this disparity, each librarian was treated as a factor in the total scholarliness score, where j represents each of the seven participants. In short, this formula allowed us to calculate a measure of scholarliness while accounting for differences in where the citations were located and between librarians. Results The mean scholarliness score of citations found only in GS was 17.6% higher than the score for citations found only in licensed library databases. In fact, across all but one of the tested disciplines, citations found only in GS had a higher average scholarliness score than citations found only in licensed library databases. The one discipline with a lower score, however, had only two unique citations in the library database, so the exact significance of the scores for that discipline is imprecise. Additionally, the citations found in both GS and licensed library databases had a higher average score than citations found only in one or the other [INSERT TABLE 3]. Finally, there was no statistically significant difference found between the scholarliness score across disciplines within GS. Searching for either a humanities topic or a science topic yielded no difference in the scholarliness score of citations discovered in GS. Discussion of Results It is interesting to note that there was very little overlap between the initial thirty citations returned by the databases and the initial thirty citations returned by GS. In fact, only one query of the seven had any overlapping citations between GS and the database an overlap of five citations from JSTOR that appeared within the first thirty results in GS. Despite this initial lack of overlap, once we began to search for specific citations, we found that GS actually contained 76% of all the citations found in the library databases, while the library databases contained only 47% of the citations found in GS. [INSERT TABLE 4] This seems to validate the decision of many students to use Google first to look for information. If GS contains much of the content available in library databases, why shouldn t How Scholarly Is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 4 students begin where the most content exists? The argument is made that GS will return millions of hits, many of which are spurious at best, while a library database will only return a few thousand results that are more focused to the query. However, the power of ordering results by relevancy, combined with the fact that very few people ever go beyond the first page of results, creates a searcher-imposed higher level of precision for any search engine. This is particularly true of GS, where the most relevant and more scholarly, material floats to the top of the list, while the less precise material falls to the bottom, where it is rarely seen. Hit counts are of secondary importance in a GS search; the key to GS s success is relevancy ranking and a large universe of information. A database is limited to its defined title list of content, whereas GS, by its very nature, is open to a much broader set of content that aids the researcher. Business Source Premier, one of the library databases, was the only library database where we found more GS citations in the database than database citations in GS. However, even in this one instance, the scholarly score for citations found only in GS was higher than the score for citations found only in the database. The citations found in both GS and the databases received even higher scores and these citations were only exposed through the first 30 hits in GS. This seems to indicate that even when GS is returning fewer titles, as in this case with Business Source Premier, it still returns citations that are more scholarly to the top. Up to this point, many of our library databases have defaulted to sorting by date rather than by relevancy. The fact that many databases are now adding relevancy search options seems to indicate that GS got it right in the first place. It appears that GS has done a better job of both precision and recall than library databases have. Many studies have compared content in library databases to content in GS and found inconsistencies. The purpose of both search systems, however, is to discover relevant, scholarly content. Using our scholarliness model, we found that, across disciplines, GS is generally superior to individual databases in retrieving appropriate citations. As more publishers share their content with GS, we would expect the effectiveness of a GS search to increase. Future Studies The statistical results from this study can be extrapolated only to the specific topics and subject librarians that were involved in the study. A more comprehensive statistical methodology would need to be constructed in order to make the results generally applicable. However, our results were compelling enough to make us believe that the results would hold up to more strenuous tests. Additionally, the rubric we used in our study was only a three-point Likert scale. Finding statistically significant differences would have been easier had we selected a seven or more point Likert scale. Additionally, our analysis used a vetted approach to evaluating scholarliness of resources. A more objective view of scholarliness could be obtained by using some variation of citation analysis (citation counts, ISI impact factor, etc.). We started to do such an analysis but decided there were too many trade-offs to be appropriate given the methodology we used for this study. For example, citation counts are difficult to come by for materials other than journal articles, and impact factors are calculated for journals only and not for specific articles. Alternate methodologies would likely be able to overcome or account for the shortcomings of using citation analysis to judge scholarliness. Our study used skilled librarians to create search queries and to judge the quality of the citations retrieved. Unlike most students, the librarians used complex search queries to find more How Scholarly is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 5 relevant results. Students would be more likely to use natural language queries to find citations. Complex search queries could return very different results from natural language queries. Future studies will need to address the potential differences to find out if the results we found hold across different types of searches. Finally, future studies need to look at the appropriateness of comparing GS to individual library databases. It is probable that federated searching is more comparable to GS than are individual library databases. However, how users and librarians select which resources to use in a federated search and how the federated search engine returns the results would still impact the discoverability of scholarly resources. Some studies have already started down this road [17], but GS result sets have still not been carefully compared to result sets from federated search products. Libraries have begun to build local GS s, using tools such as Primo (Ex Libris), AquaBrowser (Medialab Solutions), and Encore (Innovative Interfaces), that have the potential to aid users in discovering even more scholarly materials than what is currently discovered in GS. Comparing GS to a future system that has completely indexed all local content and content available to libraries but provided by third parties would be the ultimate comparison. Conclusion Typical arguments against GS focus on citation counts and point to inconsistent coverage between disciplines. We felt the more appropriate analysis was to compare the scholarliness of resources discovered using GS with resources found in library databases. This analysis showed that GS yielded more scholarly content than library databases, with no statistically significant difference in scholarliness across disciplines. Despite these findings, GS is not in competition with library databases. In truth, without the cooperation of database vendors and publishers, GS would not exist as it does today. GS is simply a discovery tool for finding scholarly information while databases still perform the function of providing access to the content unearthed by a GS search. Bibliography 1.

A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan, and Brian C. Roberts May 21, 2008 Abstract Google Scholar (GS) was released as a beta product in November of 2004. Since then, GS has been scrutinized and questioned by many in academia and the library field. Our objectives in undertaking this study were to determine how scholarly GS is in comparison with traditional library resources and to determine if the scholarliness of materials found in GS varies across disciplines. We found that GS is, on average, 17.6% more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there is no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in GS across disciplines. Introduction Google Scholar (GS) was introduced to the world in November of 2004 as a beta product. It has been embraced by students, scholars, and librarians alike. However, GS has received criticism regarding the breadth and scope of available content. We undertook this study to answer two questions regarding these common criticisms: (1) Are GS result sets more or less scholarly than licensed library database result sets? and (2) Does the scholarliness of GS vary across disciplines? Literature Review GS, which is still branded as a beta version, has not only become a common fixture in library literature but is also becoming ubiquitous in information-seeking behavior of users. GS was initially met with curiosity and skepticism [1-3]. This was followed by a period of systematic study [4-7]. More recently, there has been optimism about GS s potential to move us towards Kilgour s goal of 100% availability of information [8]. Librarians find themselves reluctantly acknowledging users preferences for one-stop information shopping by giving GS ever-increasing visibility on their web pages [9]. Even as they begrudgingly promote GS, the debate continues within the information community as to the advisability of guiding users to this tool. The view of critics like P ter Jasc [10-12], who use terms such as shallowness and artificial unintelligence to describe the program, seems to be giving way to a landscape where respected publishers (e.g., Cambridge) and platforms (e.g., JSTOR) are now offering links out to GS for more citations. Early studies of GS tried to match citations hit to hit in comparison with traditional academic search engines. Jasc even provided a web site where the curious could compare search results between GS and the likes of Nature, Wiley or Blackwell [13]. More recently, studies have appeared that track the value-added open access citations that appear uniquely in How Scholarly Is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 2 GS versus other sources [14]. However, is comprehensiveness of content the primary indicator of a resource s usefulness? Every title from every database may not be in GS, but that should not be an indictment of GS s inability to return scholarly results across disciplines. The algorithms GS uses to return result sets cannot really be compared to library database algorithms. However, what is returned can be judged for its relevancy and scholarliness. Up to this point, studies of GS have followed the example of Neuhaus et al. (2006), which compared GS content to forty-seven other databases. This title-by-title and citation-by-citation comparison is a pure numerical measure but neglects to address the efficacy of any particular search or the scholarly nature of content or algorithms in discovering that content. We felt that a different approach was needed. Rather than measuring what has gone into the database, we have sought, to some degree, to evaluate what comes out as a result of search queries. We have done this by involving subject librarians with knowledge of typical reference questions and using those questions to query both GS and discipline-specific databases. We then asked the same librarians to judge the search results using a rubric of scholarliness. This notion of scholarliness utilizes a common collection-assessment tool as outlined by Alexander [15]. This model considers many factors, including accuracy, authority, objectivity, currency, and coverage. In this way we have attempted to inject a qualitative value of GS results to the ongoing debate. Methodology We selected seven subject librarians from various academic disciplines, humanities, science and social science. Each specialist was blind to the purpose of the study. We requested that they provide us (1) a sample question that they typically receive from students, (2) a structured query to search a library database, and (3) the library database they would use for that particular query. [INSERT TABLE 1] We then used their data in two different ways. First, we translated the library database query into an equivalent search string used by GS. Using the original query and the query translated to work with GS, we searched both the library database and GS and retrieved the citations and full text for the first thirty results. We selected thirty results because research has shown that less than one percent of all users ever go to a third page of results and most search engines return about ten results per page [16]. Next, we took the citations from the library databases and determined if they could also be found using GS and took the citations from GS to see if they could also be found in the library database. This allowed us to calculate the overlap of citations between the library databases and GS. We standardized the formatting of the citations and inserted them randomly into a spreadsheet, which contained a rubric that was used to assign a scholarliness score to each of the citations. The rubric contained six criteria, based on Alexander s (1999) model of evaluating resources, to judge scholarliness: (1) accuracy, (2) authority, (3) objectivity, (4) currency, (5) coverage, and (6) relevancy. These criteria were graded on a scale of 1 (below average) to 3 (above average) and summed to create a total scholarliness score for each citation. [INSERT TABLE 2] We provided the subject librarians with the full text of each of the citations and asked them to use the rubric to evaluate the scholarliness of the individual citations. After the grading was completed, we were able to group each citation from the subject librarian into one of three How Scholarly is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 3 categories: (1) the citation was available only in the library database, (2) the citation was available only in GS, or (3) the citation was available in both the library database and GS. We have used the term exclusivity to describe the three categories. Once we had grouped the citations by category, we ran a statistical analysis that controlled for the effect of the individual librarian on the total scholarliness score, for the effect of exclusivity , and for any interaction there may have been between both librarian and exclusivity : total scholarliness score = + Ei + Lj + ELij + ijkl Where: = Average total score E = Effect due to exclusivity (i = 1, 2, 3) L = Effect due to librarian (j = 1, 2, . . . 7) EL = Interaction between exclusivity and librarian = Error term Within the context of this formula, E controls for any effect due to the exclusivity of the citation, where i represents each of the three categories of exclusivity (i.e., the citation was found only in the database, it was found only in GS, or it was found in both the database and GS). Each librarian (L) also played a role in the total scholarliness score. One librarian could have provided consistently low scores with another having a tendency toward higher scores. To account for this disparity, each librarian was treated as a factor in the total scholarliness score, where j represents each of the seven participants. In short, this formula allowed us to calculate a measure of scholarliness while accounting for differences in where the citations were located and between librarians. Results The mean scholarliness score of citations found only in GS was 17.6% higher than the score for citations found only in licensed library databases. In fact, across all but one of the tested disciplines, citations found only in GS had a higher average scholarliness score than citations found only in licensed library databases. The one discipline with a lower score, however, had only two unique citations in the library database, so the exact significance of the scores for that discipline is imprecise. Additionally, the citations found in both GS and licensed library databases had a higher average score than citations found only in one or the other [INSERT TABLE 3]. Finally, there was no statistically significant difference found between the scholarliness score across disciplines within GS. Searching for either a humanities topic or a science topic yielded no difference in the scholarliness score of citations discovered in GS. Discussion of Results It is interesting to note that there was very little overlap between the initial thirty citations returned by the databases and the initial thirty citations returned by GS. In fact, only one query of the seven had any overlapping citations between GS and the database an overlap of five citations from JSTOR that appeared within the first thirty results in GS. Despite this initial lack of overlap, once we began to search for specific citations, we found that GS actually contained 76% of all the citations found in the library databases, while the library databases contained only 47% of the citations found in GS. [INSERT TABLE 4] This seems to validate the decision of many students to use Google first to look for information. If GS contains much of the content available in library databases, why shouldn t How Scholarly Is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 4 students begin where the most content exists? The argument is made that GS will return millions of hits, many of which are spurious at best, while a library database will only return a few thousand results that are more focused to the query. However, the power of ordering results by relevancy, combined with the fact that very few people ever go beyond the first page of results, creates a searcher-imposed higher level of precision for any search engine. This is particularly true of GS, where the most relevant and more scholarly, material floats to the top of the list, while the less precise material falls to the bottom, where it is rarely seen. Hit counts are of secondary importance in a GS search; the key to GS s success is relevancy ranking and a large universe of information. A database is limited to its defined title list of content, whereas GS, by its very nature, is open to a much broader set of content that aids the researcher. Business Source Premier, one of the library databases, was the only library database where we found more GS citations in the database than database citations in GS. However, even in this one instance, the scholarly score for citations found only in GS was higher than the score for citations found only in the database. The citations found in both GS and the databases received even higher scores and these citations were only exposed through the first 30 hits in GS. This seems to indicate that even when GS is returning fewer titles, as in this case with Business Source Premier, it still returns citations that are more scholarly to the top. Up to this point, many of our library databases have defaulted to sorting by date rather than by relevancy. The fact that many databases are now adding relevancy search options seems to indicate that GS got it right in the first place. It appears that GS has done a better job of both precision and recall than library databases have. Many studies have compared content in library databases to content in GS and found inconsistencies. The purpose of both search systems, however, is to discover relevant, scholarly content. Using our scholarliness model, we found that, across disciplines, GS is generally superior to individual databases in retrieving appropriate citations. As more publishers share their content with GS, we would expect the effectiveness of a GS search to increase. Future Studies The statistical results from this study can be extrapolated only to the specific topics and subject librarians that were involved in the study. A more comprehensive statistical methodology would need to be constructed in order to make the results generally applicable. However, our results were compelling enough to make us believe that the results would hold up to more strenuous tests. Additionally, the rubric we used in our study was only a three-point Likert scale. Finding statistically significant differences would have been easier had we selected a seven or more point Likert scale. Additionally, our analysis used a vetted approach to evaluating scholarliness of resources. A more objective view of scholarliness could be obtained by using some variation of citation analysis (citation counts, ISI impact factor, etc.). We started to do such an analysis but decided there were too many trade-offs to be appropriate given the methodology we used for this study. For example, citation counts are difficult to come by for materials other than journal articles, and impact factors are calculated for journals only and not for specific articles. Alternate methodologies would likely be able to overcome or account for the shortcomings of using citation analysis to judge scholarliness. Our study used skilled librarians to create search queries and to judge the quality of the citations retrieved. Unlike most students, the librarians used complex search queries to find more How Scholarly is Google Scholar?: A Comparison of Google Scholar to Library Databases Jared L. Howland, Thomas C. Wright, Rebecca A. Boughan and Brian C. Roberts 5 relevant results. Students would be more likely to use natural language queries to find citations. Complex search queries could return very different results from natural language queries. Future studies will need to address the potential differences to find out if the results we found hold across different types of searches. Finally, future studies need to look at the appropriateness of comparing GS to individual library databases. It is probable that federated searching is more comparable to GS than are individual library databases. However, how users and librarians select which resources to use in a federated search and how the federated search engine returns the results would still impact the discoverability of scholarly resources. Some studies have already started down this road [17], but GS result sets have still not been carefully compared to result sets from federated search products. Libraries have begun to build local GS s, using tools such as Primo (Ex Libris), AquaBrowser (Medialab Solutions), and Encore (Innovative Interfaces), that have the potential to aid users in discovering even more scholarly materials than what is currently discovered in GS. Comparing GS to a future system that has completely indexed all local content and content available to libraries but provided by third parties would be the ultimate comparison. Conclusion Typical arguments against GS focus on citation counts and point to inconsistent coverage between disciplines. We felt the more appropriate analysis was to compare the scholarliness of resources discovered using GS with resources found in library databases. This analysis showed that GS yielded more scholarly content than library databases, with no statistically significant difference in scholarliness across disciplines. Despite these findings, GS is not in competition with library databases. In truth, without the cooperation of database vendors and publishers, GS would not exist as it does today. GS is simply a discovery tool for finding scholarly information while databases still perform the function of providing access to the content unearthed by a GS search. Bibliography 1.

                                "Google Scholar (GS) was released as a beta product in November of 2004. Since then, GS has been scrutinized and questioned by many in academia and the library field. Our objectives in undertaking this study were to determine how scholarly GS is in comparison with traditional library resources and to determine if the scholarliness of materials found in GS varies across disciplines. We found that GS is, on average, 17.6% more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there is no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in GS across disciplines.",

                    "How Scholarly is Google Scholar? a comparison to library databases • I’d like to start this morning by sharing a story I heard a couple years ago on the NPR program “ This American Life” • You will be hearing from Alex Blumberg, the producer of the program: “ A Little Bit of Knowledge,” Alex Blumberg, This American Life, National Public Radio, Episode 293 22 July 2005 • This story illustrates the problems that are inherent in making assumptions • Assumptions are the biggest challenge facing libraries today • Alex’s embarrassing experience was based on a set of faulty assumptions • I’d like to spend the next couple of minutes summarizing a keynote address I heard in 2008 at the North American Serials Interest Group (NASIG) Annual Conference • That keynote, given by Mike Kuniavsky, was, for me, the genesis of the project I will be discussing today • This summary will be about three- fourths summary and one- fourth my interpretation of his presentation • So, Mike Kuniavsky spoke at the NASIG 2008 annual conference about ubiquitous computing • However, he started by analogizing the world of electric motors to the world of computing • In 1910, “ electric motors were expensive, so you bought one for the house and then you bought attachments for it. The motor was a general purpose tool that was adapted as needed.” • As motors got cheaper, you started having multiple motors in the home • Instead of an attachment for a fan, you had a fan • Instead of an attachment to wash clothes, you had a washing machine • Eventually, we ended up with hyper- specialized electric motors (for example, there are now, on average, 20- 30 motors per car) • This led to many unintended consequences (vacuums -> wall- to- wall carpeting) • We see the same thing happening with computers today as what happened with electric motors at the turn of the century • We have entered the 3rd stage of computing (mainframe -> desktop -> ubiquitous computing) • The phrase ubiquitous computing was phrased in 1988 by Mark Weiser • He describes it as follows: The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. ~ Mark Weiser • The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. • Just like hyper- specialization of the electric motor led to some interesting changes, so will ubiquitous computing • Mike Kuniavsky continued by saying the following: Ubiquitous computing gives us tools to track, trade and share objects much more efficiently than any previous technology. ~ Mike Kuniavsky • Ubiquitous computing gives us tools to track, trade and share objects much more efficiently than any previous technology. • What does this mean in real terms? • Here are just a few real world examples: • You are all familiar with Netflix • Ubiquitous computing has led to a tracking system that allows for cheap and easy movie rentals and, now, even movie streaming • This model is challenging the way we think about ownership of movies • Why would you need to own a movie when you can just stream a movie straight to your TV anytime you want to watch it (you don’t even need to get out of our chair to put in the DVD) • Here’s another example: • Another example is ZipCar – rent a car anytime you need one • This is a very different idea of ownership than what we are used to • Mike described it as living in a world where everything has dotted lines around it • Instead of owning a car, you own the right to use a car • The idea of subscribing to something instead of owning it is, of course, nothing new to librarians • We have dealt with serials and aggregators for many years now • However, with the advent of ubiquitous computing, the possibilities for what we can have access to without having ownership are almost endless • It was not financially feasible to do this even just a few years ago, however, today we can get access to entire libraries • In the past, the words access and ownership were synonymous in the library world – those two terms were inextricably intertwined • There was no way for librarians to provide access without owning the material • Interlibrary loan changed that to a certain extent • However, it has only been since the advent of ubiquitous computing and the network that access and ownership have been truly decoupled • Going back to Alex Blumberg and his assumptions about Nielsen families, the biggest assumption librarians are now questioning is that we must own content in order to provide research- quality resources • Just how far will this idea go? • How many resources are really so critical to a research library’s mission that we must own them? • And how many of our resources would it be okay for us to just have access to them? • In other words, the big question is ownership vs… • access • There is no one- size- fits- all answer • However, access, rather than ownership, may be the best answer in many cases in the future • Finding the optimal mix (the right answer) all depends on where we are willing to see dotted lines in our world • But most of all, it depends on how willing we are to go back to the assumptions we made about Nielsen families as a kid and really start to question them • I’ve dubbed this phenomenon: Kuniavsky’s Law: Ubiquitous computing decoupled access and ownership • Kuniavsky’s law: Ubiquitous computing has permanently decoupled access and ownership • The second principle I’d like to talk about today is access and discoverability • The music industry serves as a great example of this • Specifically, records • We already discussed how electric motors gained popularity at the turn of the last century • One of the hyper- specialized uses of the electric motor was the turntable • The turntable allowed for playback of recorded music, speeches and other orally communicated content • However, if you wanted a specific song on the record album, you had to know where to place the needle attached to the end of the record player’s arm • In other words, the content was accessible, but discovery was sub- optimal • Other technologies came and went, but discovery was still not very good • Then, the compact disc came along • The discs were broken into tracks that allowed for quick access and quick discovery • Discovery has increased significantly with the advent of services such as iTunes where you can search through hundreds of thousands of albums and find the exact song or other content that you were looking for • iTunes and other similar services, such as Pandora (US only), last. fm or Jango, even provide recommendations based on your past music consumption which opens up whole new doors to discovering new- to- you music • Libraries have followed a similar path as the music industry • Before the advent of the network, and specifically the online library catalog, discovery was tedious • To find anything, you had to scour the library card catalog • At the risk of sounding like a very bad librarian, I will tell you that I was never very good at using the card catalog system • It was hard! • Fortunately, I came into librarianship several years after most libraries migrated to online catalogs • Then the network came along which opened up many opportunities for improving discovery of library collections • WorldCat was created and collocated many libraries’ collections and made discovering the nearest location with access a breeze • But WorldCat was the equivalent of the compact disc • It revolutionized discovery, but it was still largely an analog tool • Discovery was digital but access was still analog • Google Scholar is to libraries, what iTunes was to the music industry • It has streamlined both discovery and access to library collections • It integrates with WorldCat so it knows what your print collections are and, if you use your link resolver to give Google your information, it will also know what your electronic collections are • I call this Google Scholar’s Law Google Scholar’s Law: Google Scholar decoupled access and discovery • Kuniavsky’s law states that ubiquitous computing decoupled access and ownership • Google Scholar’s law states that Google Scholar, a direct outgrowth of ubiquitous computing, has decoupled access and discovery • So if computers are doing all of this, where does this leave libraries? • My contention today, is that libraries are here to provide access to our patrons to the content that they need • If discovery is best left to Google Scholar and the network at large, libraries should concentrate on building their own collections, which is our strength • Leave the discovery to others that seem to have the advantage • I want to talk today about some research that my colleagues and I have been working on • The question we wanted to answer was, is Google Scholar a good discovery tool? • Specifically, we wanted to know how the results returned in Google Scholar compared to results in library databases • In other words, which is the better discovery tool? • Library databases or Google Scholar Literature Review • As you might imagine, there was a significant amount of skepticism in the library world when Google Scholar was introduced • Many did not want to acknowledge that Google Scholar might have an important role to play in every librarian’s toolbox • It might be helpful to give a little bit of history: • Before Google, there were a whole host of search engines available to the average internet user • You may recognize some or all of these • How many of you still use one or more of these search engines? • How many of you use Google? (general public search engine use - 65% only use Google) • Most of these search engines are now gone - they were eaten by the monster that Google became • Here is what Google looked like when it was first released for public consumption in 1998 • There were over 25 million pages indexed! :) • The last time they announced how big the index is was in 2005 - it had well over 25 billion pages indexed at that point • So by the time that Google Scholar was introduced, at the end of 2004, Google had lots of search and, more importantly, discovery experience • Despite all this skepticism, many librarians began placing Google Scholar on the homepages of their sites • Many articles were published about Google Scholar • Some of the better and more comprehensive studies were conducted by Peter Jasco, from the University of Hawaii • He described Google Scholar’s search results with such glowing terms as “ shallowness” and, my personal favorite, “ artificial unintelligence” • Other studies tried to match citations “ hit to hit” • These studies were conducted by Neuhaus, Brophy and Bawden • This means that they would gather a large data set from respected database vendors, such as ISI’s Web of Science, and try to find all of the citations in that database to what was available in Google Scholar • They found the obvious - Google Scholar’s coverage was spotty and had lots of holes in it • This is because Google Scholar indexes from reputable sources, such as publisher’s websites (when they’re given permission) but also gathers information from professor’s personal websites, other pages in the . edu domain and from institutional repositories • The nature of those sources is incomplete • The nature of those sources also allows Google to more readily identify and index the seminal research in most disciplines • Library databases typically have a much harder time identifying those types of papers • This also allows Google to identify the prominent authors in each discipline • After the initial onslaught of negative reviews, authors began looking at some of the value- added services that Google Scholar adds for researchers • These value- added features include tracking open access content and other content found in institutional repositories • This line of research was done by Kousha, Thelwall among others • More recently Peter Jasco has re- evaluated Google Scholar and found the results to be much better than they were intially but still found many problems with the way it counts citations and other relatively minor quibbles about the service • The research that we undertook was a very different approach from these other studies • The studies by Neuhaus and others looked at all the content that was going into Google Scholar and found it lacking • We wanted to look at the outcomes of Google Scholar searches • Specifically, we wanted to know if the Google Scholar results were more or less scholarly than the results found in library databases • We did this by directly comparing search results from Google Scholar to search results from library databases • Before Google, there were a whole host of search engines available to the average internet user • You may recognize some or all of these • How many of you still use one or more of these search engines? • How many of you use Google?

How does the acquisition and use of a second language in children affect their general cognitive development? A question they would typically receive from a student (humanities) (bilingual* OR L2) AND (child* OR toddler) AND “ cognitive development” A structured query they would use to search a database Linguistic and Language Behavior Abstracts The database they would use to search for that question Academic Discipline Database Query Library Database Science (ACL or “ anterior cruciate ligament*”) and injur* and (athlet* or sport or sports) and (therap* or treat* or rehab*) SportDiscus Science lung cancer and (etiol* or caus*) and (cigarette* or smok* or nicotine*) Medline Science “ dark matter” and evidence Applied Science and Technology Abstracts Social Science (“ fast food” or mcdonald’s or wendy’s or “ burger king” or restaurant) and franchis* and (knowledge n3 transfer or “ knowledge management” or train*) Business Source Premier Social Science (“ standardized test*” or “ high stakes test*”) and (“ learning disabilit*” or Dyslexia or “ learning problem”) and accommodat* PsycINFO Humanities (bilingual* or L2) and (child* or toddler) and “ cognitive development” Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts Humanities (memor* or remembrance or memoir*) and (holocaust) and (Spiegelman or Maus) JSTOR This is what things looked like after we got all the information back from the librarians Methodology Search using query Then we took that information and used it in 2 ways. Native database results The first was to actually run the search query in the suggested database. We put the first 30 citations into a bibliographic citation manager and saved all of the actual full text We chose 30 because usability studies (Jakob Neilsen) tell us that less than 1% of all users ever go beyond the 3rd page of results and very few people ever change the defaults (ie, once they run a search they stick with it, success or failure). Most of our DBs present 10 results per page so 30 results should represent a large enough sample to represent the actual set of results the majority of our users is ever going to see after performing a search. Google Scholar Results We ran the same query in Google Scholar and saved the results again in a bibliographic Manager. We used Zotero to quickly export all of the results. We also saved the full text of each citation for later use in our study. Methodology Search using citations So, the first searches we ran using the native DBs and GS was for the query given to us by the librarian The second set of searches we ran was to see if the citations we found in the DB were available in GS and vice versa Is this citation available in Google Scholar? Here is the same screenshot we saw just a minute ago. We took the bibliographic information for each citation and searched for the citation within Google Scholar. We then did the same thing in reverse. We took the 30 results from GS and searched for each citation within the database in GS in in both DB Exclusivity This allowed us to later calculate something we called “ exclusivity” We put the citations into 1 of 3 possible “ exclusivity” categories Shows proportion of citations within our study that overlap. As you can see, within our study we found that, on average, GS had a larger result set overall as well as more exclusively than the databases. Methodology Citation grading So now that we have the citations from the database and the citations from Google Scholar. We used the bibliographic manager to generate a list of references that we input into an Excel spreadsheet. Then, using a random number table, we completely randomized the order of the citations for each subject specialist. Finally, to deliver the content to the librarians in a way in which it would be easiest for them to evaluate, we saved the full- text of each citation according to its randomly assigned citation number. Then we used Excel to create hyperlinks to the full- text of each citation and delivered this list along with the full- text on a CD to the subject librarians. We asked them to evaluate each citation using a rubric which we provided in hard copy form. As you can see, the subject librarians were only able to see the citation number and the bibliographic information. By clicking on the hyperlinked citation number, the full- text of that citation would appear and the subject librarians could easily rate the citation on the rubric. Have full text appear on this page after click to simulate linking from provided document.

Accuracy: Authority: Objectivity: Currency: Coverage: Relevancy: reliability, fact checkers/ editors, peer review author’s qualifications, reputable publisher minimum bias, extent to which persuasion is the goal information up to date, date of publication indicated depth of coverage related to research topic This screen shows the rubric that we used. It is based on a rubric that has popularly been used to evaluate print resources (Alexander, 1999) Alexander, J. E. (1999). Web wisdom: How to evaluate and create information quality on the Web. We asked each subject librarian to assign a score of between 1 and 3 within 6 different categories to each of the citations (1 was below average, 2 was average and 3 was above average). These six categories were: Accuracy – which looks at Authority – specifically the Objectivity – looking for Currency – is the information up to date? How deep is the Coverage And finally Relevancy – how well does the citation relate to the research question This resulted in a total possible score of 18 for each citation - we called this a scholarliness score Methodology total scholarliness score = μ + Ei + Lj + ELij + εijkl where μ = Average total score E = Effect due to exclusivity (i = 1, 2, 3) L = Effect due to librarian (j = 1, 2, ... 7) EL = Interaction between exclusivity and librarian ε = Error term We used this statistical model to evaluate the data. Essentially this formula says 2 important things about the way we used the data: 1. We controlled for the differences between the way librarians grade 2. We controlled for the differences in how exclusively the citation was available This allowed us to pinpoint and measure any differences there may have been between disciplines in our data as well as any differences that can be attributed to the source of the citations Results Google Scholar was 17.6% more scholarly Citations found only in GS had, on average, a 17.6% higher scholarliness score than citations found only in the DB Results Highest scholarliness score when found in both Citations found in both GS and the DB were even higher than citations found only in GS Results No difference between disciplines We found no statistically significant difference in the scholarliness scores between disciplines (ie, humanities citations in GS are just as scholarly as science citations found in GS) 0 9 18 AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 14.3 13.9 11.5 14.3 15.6 14.6 13.5 14.2 14.4 12.8 11.6 13.5 12.0 13.8 16.1 14.0 11.9 11.7 13.2 10.0 10.0 11.7 16.5 Average Scholarliness Score Only in database Only in GS In both 0% 50% 100% AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 47% 43% 97% 80% 28% 47% 35% 82% 93% 97% 100% 83% 76% 77% database citations in GS GS citations in database Exclusivity of Citations Future Studies Generally applicable results This study can only be extrapolated statistically to the specific topics and subject specialists used in this study A more robust statistical methodology would need to be employed to make these results generally applicable We are encouraged by the results we received and feel that they would probably hold up but cannot say so until another study is done Future Studies Improved rubric If we had to do it over again, we would have increased the Likert scale on our rubric from 1- 3 to 1- 7 or 1- 10 This would have allowed for a more nuanced statistical analysis and made it easier to spot significant differences, if any, between GS and databases Future Studies Scholarliness calculation Our scholarliness calculation, ultimately, was based on the subjective opinions of librarians with subject expertise. There are lots of ways to create a scholarliness score (citation counts, impact factors, etc). Which is best is still debatable Future Studies Comparison to federated searching Our study compared GS to individual library databases. A more appropriate comparison may be GS to federated search tools. Questions? jared_ howland@ byu. edu"

                                "How Scholarly is Google Scholar? a comparison to library databases • I’d like to start this morning by sharing a story I heard a couple years ago on the NPR program “ This American Life” • You will be hearing from Alex Blumberg, the producer of the program: “ A Little Bit of Knowledge,” Alex Blumberg, This American Life, National Public Radio, Episode 293 22 July 2005 • This story illustrates the problems that are inherent in making assumptions • Assumptions are the biggest challenge facing libraries today • Alex’s embarrassing experience was based on a set of faulty assumptions • I’d like to spend the next couple of minutes summarizing a keynote address I heard in 2008 at the North American Serials Interest Group ( NASIG) Annual Conference • That keynote, given by Mike Kuniavsky, was, for me, the genesis of the project I will be discussing today • This summary will be about three- fourths summary and one- fourth my interpretation of his presentation • So, Mike Kuniavsky spoke at the NASIG 2008 annual conference about ubiquitous computing • However, he started by analogizing the world of electric motors to the world of computing • In 1910, “ electric motors were expensive, so you bought one for the house and then you bought attachments for it. The motor was a general purpose tool that was adapted as needed.” • As motors got cheaper, you started having multiple motors in the home • Instead of an attachment for a fan, you had a fan • Instead of an attachment to wash clothes, you had a washing machine • Eventually, we ended up with hyper- specialized electric motors ( for example, there are now, on average, 20- 30 motors per car) • This led to many unintended consequences ( vacuums -> wall- to- wall carpeting) • We see the same thing happening with computers today as what happened with electric motors at the turn of the century • We have entered the 3rd stage of computing ( mainframe -> desktop -> ubiquitous computing) • The phrase ubiquitous computing was phrased in 1988 by Mark Weiser • He describes it as follows: The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. ~ Mark Weiser • The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. • Just like hyper- specialization of the electric motor led to some interesting changes, so will ubiquitous computing • Mike Kuniavsky continued by saying the following: Ubiquitous computing gives us tools to track, trade and share objects much more efficiently than any previous technology. ~ Mike Kuniavsky • Ubiquitous computing gives us tools to track, trade and share objects much more efficiently than any previous technology. • What does this mean in real terms? • Here are just a few real world examples: • You are all familiar with Netflix • Ubiquitous computing has led to a tracking system that allows for cheap and easy movie rentals and, now, even movie streaming • This model is challenging the way we think about ownership of movies • Why would you need to own a movie when you can just stream a movie straight to your TV anytime you want to watch it ( you don’t even need to get out of our chair to put in the DVD) • Here’s another example: • Another example is ZipCar – rent a car anytime you need one • This is a very different idea of ownership than what we are used to • Mike described it as living in a world where everything has dotted lines around it • Instead of owning a car, you own the right to use a car • The idea of subscribing to something instead of owning it is, of course, nothing new to librarians • We have dealt with serials and aggregators for many years now • However, with the advent of ubiquitous computing, the possibilities for what we can have access to without having ownership are almost endless • It was not financially feasible to do this even just a few years ago, however, today we can get access to entire libraries • In the past, the words access and ownership were synonymous in the library world – those two terms were inextricably intertwined • There was no way for librarians to provide access without owning the material • Interlibrary loan changed that to a certain extent • However, it has only been since the advent of ubiquitous computing and the network that access and ownership have been truly decoupled • Going back to Alex Blumberg and his assumptions about Nielsen families, the biggest assumption librarians are now questioning is that we must own content in order to provide research- quality resources • Just how far will this idea go? • How many resources are really so critical to a research library’s mission that we must own them? • And how many of our resources would it be okay for us to just have access to them? • In other words, the big question is ownership vs… • access • There is no one- size- fits- all answer • However, access, rather than ownership, may be the best answer in many cases in the future • Finding the optimal mix ( the right answer) all depends on where we are willing to see dotted lines in our world • But most of all, it depends on how willing we are to go back to the assumptions we made about Nielsen families as a kid and really start to question them • I’ve dubbed this phenomenon: Kuniavsky’s Law: Ubiquitous computing decoupled access and ownership • Kuniavsky’s law: Ubiquitous computing has permanently decoupled access and ownership • The second principle I’d like to talk about today is access and discoverability • The music industry serves as a great example of this • Specifically, records • We already discussed how electric motors gained popularity at the turn of the last century • One of the hyper- specialized uses of the electric motor was the turntable • The turntable allowed for playback of recorded music, speeches and other orally communicated content • However, if you wanted a specific song on the record album, you had to know where to place the needle attached to the end of the record player’s arm • In other words, the content was accessible, but discovery was sub- optimal • Other technologies came and went, but discovery was still not very good • Then, the compact disc came along • The discs were broken into tracks that allowed for quick access and quick discovery • Discovery has increased significantly with the advent of services such as iTunes where you can search through hundreds of thousands of albums and find the exact song or other content that you were looking for • iTunes and other similar services, such as Pandora ( US only), last. fm or Jango, even provide recommendations based on your past music consumption which opens up whole new doors to discovering new- to- you music • Libraries have followed a similar path as the music industry • Before the advent of the network, and specifically the online library catalog, discovery was tedious • To find anything, you had to scour the library card catalog • At the risk of sounding like a very bad librarian, I will tell you that I was never very good at using the card catalog system • It was hard! • Fortunately, I came into librarianship several years after most libraries migrated to online catalogs • Then the network came along which opened up many opportunities for improving discovery of library collections • WorldCat was created and collocated many libraries’ collections and made discovering the nearest location with access a breeze • But WorldCat was the equivalent of the compact disc • It revolutionized discovery, but it was still largely an analog tool • Discovery was digital but access was still analog • Google Scholar is to libraries, what iTunes was to the music industry • It has streamlined both discovery and access to library collections • It integrates with WorldCat so it knows what your print collections are and, if you use your link resolver to give Google your information, it will also know what your electronic collections are • I call this Google Scholar’s Law Google Scholar’s Law: Google Scholar decoupled access and discovery • Kuniavsky’s law states that ubiquitous computing decoupled access and ownership • Google Scholar’s law states that Google Scholar, a direct outgrowth of ubiquitous computing, has decoupled access and discovery • So if computers are doing all of this, where does this leave libraries? • My contention today, is that libraries are here to provide access to our patrons to the content that they need • If discovery is best left to Google Scholar and the network at large, libraries should concentrate on building their own collections, which is our strength • Leave the discovery to others that seem to have the advantage • I want to talk today about some research that my colleagues and I have been working on • The question we wanted to answer was, is Google Scholar a good discovery tool? • Specifically, we wanted to know how the results returned in Google Scholar compared to results in library databases • In other words, which is the better discovery tool? • Library databases or Google Scholar Literature Review • As you might imagine, there was a significant amount of skepticism in the library world when Google Scholar was introduced • Many did not want to acknowledge that Google Scholar might have an important role to play in every librarian’s toolbox • It might be helpful to give a little bit of history: • Before Google, there were a whole host of search engines available to the average internet user • You may recognize some or all of these • How many of you still use one or more of these search engines? • How many of you use Google? ( general public search engine use - 65% only use Google) • Most of these search engines are now gone - they were eaten by the monster that Google became • Here is what Google looked like when it was first released for public consumption in 1998 • There were over 25 million pages indexed! :) • The last time they announced how big the index is was in 2005 - it had well over 25 billion pages indexed at that point • So by the time that Google Scholar was introduced, at the end of 2004, Google had lots of search and, more importantly, discovery experience • Despite all this skepticism, many librarians began placing Google Scholar on the homepages of their sites • Many articles were published about Google Scholar • Some of the better and more comprehensive studies were conducted by Peter Jasco, from the University of Hawaii • He described Google Scholar’s search results with such glowing terms as “ shallowness” and, my personal favorite, “ artificial unintelligence” • Other studies tried to match citations “ hit to hit” • These studies were conducted by Neuhaus, Brophy and Bawden • This means that they would gather a large data set from respected database vendors, such as ISI’s Web of Science, and try to find all of the citations in that database to what was available in Google Scholar • They found the obvious - Google Scholar’s coverage was spotty and had lots of holes in it • This is because Google Scholar indexes from reputable sources, such as publisher’s websites ( when they’re given permission) but also gathers information from professor’s personal websites, other pages in the . edu domain and from institutional repositories • The nature of those sources is incomplete • The nature of those sources also allows Google to more readily identify and index the seminal research in most disciplines • Library databases typically have a much harder time identifying those types of papers • This also allows Google to identify the prominent authors in each discipline • After the initial onslaught of negative reviews, authors began looking at some of the value- added services that Google Scholar adds for researchers • These value- added features include tracking open access content and other content found in institutional repositories • This line of research was done by Kousha, Thelwall among others • More recently Peter Jasco has re- evaluated Google Scholar and found the results to be much better than they were intially but still found many problems with the way it counts citations and other relatively minor quibbles about the service • The research that we undertook was a very different approach from these other studies • The studies by Neuhaus and others looked at all the content that was going into Google Scholar and found it lacking • We wanted to look at the outcomes of Google Scholar searches • Specifically, we wanted to know if the Google Scholar results were more or less scholarly than the results found in library databases • We did this by directly comparing search results from Google Scholar to search results from library databases • Before Google, there were a whole host of search engines available to the average internet user • You may recognize some or all of these • How many of you still use one or more of these search engines? • How many of you use Google?

How does the acquisition and use of a second language in children affect their general cognitive development? A question they would typically receive from a student ( humanities) ( bilingual* OR L2) AND ( child* OR toddler) AND “ cognitive development” A structured query they would use to search a database Linguistic and Language Behavior Abstracts The database they would use to search for that question Academic Discipline Database Query Library Database Science ( ACL or “ anterior cruciate ligament*”) and injur* and ( athlet* or sport or sports) and ( therap* or treat* or rehab*) SportDiscus Science lung cancer and ( etiol* or caus*) and ( cigarette* or smok* or nicotine*) Medline Science “ dark matter” and evidence Applied Science and Technology Abstracts Social Science (“ fast food” or mcdonald’s or wendy’s or “ burger king” or restaurant) and franchis* and ( knowledge n3 transfer or “ knowledge management” or train*) Business Source Premier Social Science (“ standardized test*” or “ high stakes test*”) and (“ learning disabilit*” or Dyslexia or “ learning problem”) and accommodat* PsycINFO Humanities ( bilingual* or L2) and ( child* or toddler) and “ cognitive development” Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts Humanities ( memor* or remembrance or memoir*) and ( holocaust) and ( Spiegelman or Maus) JSTOR This is what things looked like after we got all the information back from the librarians Methodology Search using query Then we took that information and used it in 2 ways. Native database results The first was to actually run the search query in the suggested database. We put the first 30 citations into a bibliographic citation manager and saved all of the actual full text We chose 30 because usability studies ( Jakob Neilsen) tell us that less than 1% of all users ever go beyond the 3rd page of results and very few people ever change the defaults ( ie, once they run a search they stick with it, success or failure). Most of our DBs present 10 results per page so 30 results should represent a large enough sample to represent the actual set of results the majority of our users is ever going to see after performing a search. Google Scholar Results We ran the same query in Google Scholar and saved the results again in a bibliographic Manager. We used Zotero to quickly export all of the results. We also saved the full text of each citation for later use in our study. Methodology Search using citations So, the first searches we ran using the native DBs and GS was for the query given to us by the librarian The second set of searches we ran was to see if the citations we found in the DB were available in GS and vice versa Is this citation available in Google Scholar? Here is the same screenshot we saw just a minute ago. We took the bibliographic information for each citation and searched for the citation within Google Scholar. We then did the same thing in reverse. We took the 30 results from GS and searched for each citation within the database in GS in in both DB Exclusivity This allowed us to later calculate something we called “ exclusivity” We put the citations into 1 of 3 possible “ exclusivity” categories Shows proportion of citations within our study that overlap. As you can see, within our study we found that, on average, GS had a larger result set overall as well as more exclusively than the databases. Methodology Citation grading So now that we have the citations from the database and the citations from Google Scholar. We used the bibliographic manager to generate a list of references that we input into an Excel spreadsheet. Then, using a random number table, we completely randomized the order of the citations for each subject specialist. Finally, to deliver the content to the librarians in a way in which it would be easiest for them to evaluate, we saved the full- text of each citation according to its randomly assigned citation number. Then we used Excel to create hyperlinks to the full- text of each citation and delivered this list along with the full- text on a CD to the subject librarians. We asked them to evaluate each citation using a rubric which we provided in hard copy form. As you can see, the subject librarians were only able to see the citation number and the bibliographic information. By clicking on the hyperlinked citation number, the full- text of that citation would appear and the subject librarians could easily rate the citation on the rubric. Have full text appear on this page after click to simulate linking from provided document.

Accuracy: Authority: Objectivity: Currency: Coverage: Relevancy: reliability, fact checkers/ editors, peer review author’s qualifications, reputable publisher minimum bias, extent to which persuasion is the goal information up to date, date of publication indicated depth of coverage related to research topic This screen shows the rubric that we used. It is based on a rubric that has popularly been used to evaluate print resources ( Alexander, 1999) Alexander, J. E. ( 1999). Web wisdom: How to evaluate and create information quality on the Web. We asked each subject librarian to assign a score of between 1 and 3 within 6 different categories to each of the citations ( 1 was below average, 2 was average and 3 was above average). These six categories were: Accuracy – which looks at Authority – specifically the Objectivity – looking for Currency – is the information up to date? How deep is the Coverage And finally Relevancy – how well does the citation relate to the research question This resulted in a total possible score of 18 for each citation - we called this a scholarliness score Methodology total scholarliness score = μ + Ei + Lj + ELij + εijkl where μ = Average total score E = Effect due to exclusivity ( i = 1, 2, 3) L = Effect due to librarian ( j = 1, 2, ... 7) EL = Interaction between exclusivity and librarian ε = Error term We used this statistical model to evaluate the data. Essentially this formula says 2 important things about the way we used the data: 1. We controlled for the differences between the way librarians grade 2. We controlled for the differences in how exclusively the citation was available This allowed us to pinpoint and measure any differences there may have been between disciplines in our data as well as any differences that can be attributed to the source of the citations Results Google Scholar was 17.6% more scholarly Citations found only in GS had, on average, a 17.6% higher scholarliness score than citations found only in the DB Results Highest scholarliness score when found in both Citations found in both GS and the DB were even higher than citations found only in GS Results No difference between disciplines We found no statistically significant difference in the scholarliness scores between disciplines ( ie, humanities citations in GS are just as scholarly as science citations found in GS) 0 9 18 AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 14.3 13.9 11.5 14.3 15.6 14.6 13.5 14.2 14.4 12.8 11.6 13.5 12.0 13.8 16.1 14.0 11.9 11.7 13.2 10.0 10.0 11.7 16.5 Average Scholarliness Score Only in database Only in GS In both 0% 50% 100% AVERAGE Physics Linguistics Biology Medicine Literature Business Education 47% 43% 97% 80% 28% 47% 35% 82% 93% 97% 100% 83% 76% 77% database citations in GS GS citations in database Exclusivity of Citations Future Studies Generally applicable results This study can only be extrapolated statistically to the specific topics and subject specialists used in this study A more robust statistical methodology would need to be employed to make these results generally applicable We are encouraged by the results we received and feel that they would probably hold up but cannot say so until another study is done Future Studies Improved rubric If we had to do it over again, we would have increased the Likert scale on our rubric from 1- 3 to 1- 7 or 1- 10 This would have allowed for a more nuanced statistical analysis and made it easier to spot significant differences, if any, between GS and databases Future Studies Scholarliness calculation Our scholarliness calculation, ultimately, was based on the subjective opinions of librarians with subject expertise. There are lots of ways to create a scholarliness score ( citation counts, impact factors, etc). Which is best is still debatable Future Studies Comparison to federated searching Our study compared GS to individual library databases. A more appropriate comparison may be GS to federated search tools. Questions? jared_ howland@ byu. edu"

The scope of protection afforded to the trademark holder turns on the psychology and behavior of the ? ordinary? consumer ? under the normally prevalent conditions of the market and giving the attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods.? 1 In trademark law, ? everything hinges upon whether there is a likelihood of confusion in the mind of an appreciable number of = reasonably prudent‘ buyers.? 2 Where the ordinary consumer is deemed sufficiently ? sophisticated? to discern differences between two competing marks, the law forecloses protection for the senior trademark. 3 Although the ordinary consumer‘ s mindset is central to trademark law and policy, neither courts nor commentators have made any serious attempt to develop a framework for understanding the conditions that may affect the attention that can be expected to be given to a particular purchase. Some of the classic judicial descriptions cast the ordinary consumer as ? ignorant . . . unthinking and . . . credulous? 4 or ? hasty, heedless and easily deceived.? 5 In other cases, the courts have bristled at the ? claimed asininity? of the buying public, 6 suggesting instead that the average buyer is ? neither savant nor dolt,?

The academic literature is marked by a similarly empty rift. On one hand, so- called ? apologist? trademark commentary paints a picture of the consumer as the ? fool?— one highly susceptible to even the slightest suggestion of a connection between two trademarks. 8 So- called ? restrictionist? commentary quarrels with the ? conception of a consumerate of = presumptive idiots‘ who are = apparently befuddled by nearly everything.‘? 9 Scholars on the restrictionist side of the divide see the consumer as an informed ? sovereign? who is ? actually habituated to ambiguity,? such that ? the degree of confusion [ she is] actually likely to suffer is less than might otherwise be thought.? 10 This fundamental disagreement is at the heart of a core theoretical divide in the trademark commentary. As Barton Beebe has noted, The commentator proceeds from an initial assumption about the degree to which consumers act or are acted upon, about the degree to which they are creative subjects or the created objects of the trademark system . . . . The apologist commentator traditionally assumes that consumers act, the restrictionist, that consumers are 7 United States v. 88 Cases, More or Less, Containing Bireley‘ s Orange Beverage, 187 F. 2d 967, 971 (3d Cir. 1951) (rejecting ? the ignorant, the unthinking, and the credulous? standard as an ? extraordinary standard?). 8 See Barton Beebe, Search and Persuasion in Trademark Law, 103 MICH.

From these premises follow calls for more or less or at least different kinds of paternalism. 11 Although scholars offer strikingly different portrayals of the reasonably prudent purchaser, neither camp has attempted a comprehensive examination of the theoretical or empirical bases for their positions. Even Beebe, who makes a significant contribution in identifying some internal conflicts in each side‘ s positions, openly declines to ? take sides in this debate,? 12 while acknowledging that ? trademark law lacks a well- developed theory of the consumer, and, specifically, of consumer sophistication.? 13 This Article attempts to fill that void. We take seriously the oft- repeated— but seldom heeded— view that the fields of ? cognitive and consumer psychology? have ? much to offer those interested in trademark law.? 14 Borrowing from scholarly literature in marketing and consumer psychology, we develop an extensive model of consumer sophistication. In the sections below, we first present a general summary of the relevant case law and then introduce the consumer behavior model that will serve as the core of our analysis. The model identifies two general antecedents to the exercise of consumer care (or ? cognition,? as it is phrased in the literature) by a sophisticated consumer: a sufficient level of ? motivation? for care and an adequate ? ability? to be careful. 15 After developing the motivation and ability elements in some detail, we employ the model to analyze a strand of case law that is at the heart of the 11 Beebe, supra note 8, at 2069. 12 Id. at 2025.

The informed, rigorous view of the consumer that emerges is much more nuanced and complex than that of either fool or sovereign. We offer a positive framework for understanding the basic strands of the judicial conceptions of consumer sophistication and interject normative criticism in cases where we find fault with the jurisprudence. Lastly, we employ the model to take a broader look at the relevance (and relative significance) of consumer sophistication in trademark infringement cases. Our methodology offers insights that can inform— and transform— a broad range of issues in a body of law that can no longer afford to ignore the field of consumer psychology. By moving beyond stereotypes and rhetorical flourishes about the validity vel non of the portrayal of the consumer as the ? presumptive idiot,? our model opens analytical doors that account for the realities of consumer behavior and helps to resolve many of the conflicts and inconsistencies in trademark law. I. THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION AND THE REASONABLY PRUDENT CONSUMER The legal touchstone of trademark infringement is a showing of a likelihood of consumer confusion. 16 In evaluating the likelihood of confusion, the standard focuses on the ? ordinary? or ? reasonably prudent? consumer. 17 As noted above, the courts have expressed a range of different views as to the mindset of this ? ordinary? or ? reasonably prudent? consumer. 18 To some degree, the cases leave room for the impression that courts may simply be ? adjusting their finding of whether the relevant consumer population is 16 See 15 U. S. C. § 1114(1) (2006) (establishing that a federally registered mark is infringed where the defendant‘ s use is ? likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive?). 17 See Savin Corp. v. Savin Group, 391 F. 3d 439, 461 (2d Cir. 2004) (?[ T] he pertinent question is whether = numerous ordinary prudent purchasers‘ would likely = be misled or confused as to the source of the product in question because of the entrance in the marketplace of [ Defendants‘] mark.‘?); Dreamwerks Prod. Group, Inc. v. SKG Studio, 142 F. 3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir. 1998) (? The test for likelihood of confusion is whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.?); see also MCCARTHY, supra note 2, § 23: 93 (asserting and citing extensive cases for the proposition that ? everything hinges upon whether there is a likelihood of confusion in the mind of an appreciable number of = reasonably prudent‘ buyers?). 18 See sources cited supra note 17. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 579 sophisticated or unsophisticated to conform to the result they wish to achieve.? 19 Despite this cynical characterization, the courts have long evaluated the likelihood of confusion under a series of circumstantial factors. The seminal federal case under the Lanham Act is Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 20 which identified the following eight factors relevant to the likelihood of confusion: [ T] he strength of [ the plaintiff‘ s] mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the [ competitive] proximity of the products [ or services], the likelihood that [ the plaintiff] will bridge the gap [ between two markets], [ the existence of] actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant‘ s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of [ the] defendant‘ s product, and the sophistication of the buyers. 21 Since then, federal courts have offered some variations on these themes, but courts continue to focus primarily on the areas identified by the Second Circuit. 22 The eighth factor, referred to alternatively as the ? consumer‘ s degree of care,? 23 or ? consumer sophistication,? 24 encompasses several considerations that are thought by the courts to affect the attention consumers may pay to their purchases. Under this factor, the courts generally hold that if a consumer can be expected to exercise a high degree of care, she will be less likely to be confused by any connection between a senior and junior trademark. 25 A 19 Beebe, supra note 8, at 2040; see also id. at n. 85 (?[ A] cynic would say that . . . when the court wants to find no infringement, it says that the average buyer is cautious and careful . . . [ b] ut if the judge thinks there is infringement, the judge sets the standard lower and says the average buyer is gullible and not so discerning.?) (quoting MCCARTHY, supra note 2, § 23: 92). 20 287 F. 2d 492 (2d Cir. 1961). 21 Id. at 495. 22 See MCCARTHY, supra note 2, at § 23: 19 (comparing the Polaroid factors to those applied in other circuits and tracing the development of the test from factors identified in the first Restatement of Torts and Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition). Of the eight Polaroid factors, the seventh (quality of the defendant‘ s product) is the one rogue factor that is not ordinarily adopted in other circuits. See Beebe, supra note 13, at 1644 (noting that this factor is ? considered only by the Second and D. C. Circuits?). As Barton Beebe has noted, the various circuits do differ, to some degree, in the nature and wording of the factors they identify and, more importantly, in the weight they appear to give them. See id. at 1587– 91 (identifying the points of convergence among the federal circuit courts); id. at 1621– 22 (noting some of the variations in the courts‘ ? propensity to stampede the factors?). 23 E. g., Sally Beauty Co. v. Beautyco, Inc., 304 F. 3d 964, 975 (10th Cir. 2002). 24 E. g., Bristol- Myers Squibb Co. v. McNeil- P. P. C., Inc., 973 F. 2d 1033, 1047 (2d Cir. 1992). 25 E. g., Sally Beauty Co., 304 F. 3d at 975. 580 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 sophisticated consumer is expected to act not on ? impulse,? but on the basis of ? a careful consideration of the reliability and dependability of the manufacturer and seller of the product.? 26 In other words, a sophisticated consumer is one who is apt to spend more time, attention, or care in making a purchasing decision— and who is thus deemed less likely to be confused as to the source or sponsorship of the trademarked products she buys. 27 Unsophisticated consumers, by contrast, are ? the ignorant, the unthinking[,] and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze, but are governed by appearance and general impressions.? 28 The prototypical unsophisticated consumer is the man walking the supermarket aisle who ? undergo[ es] . . . an experience not unlike that of hypnosis,? 29 in which purchases are made impulsively and thoughtlessly. A key threshold question in the case law is how to distinguish the careful and sophisticated consumer from the unthinking and credulous one. Although the courts have not attempted to articulate any comprehensive theoretical framework for assessing consumer propensities toward care, a few consistent themes have emerged in the case law. 30 The principal strands of analysis in the case law, which are elaborated and evaluated in some detail below, include the assertion that consumer care or sophistication correlates positively with price, 31 length and complexity of the purchase transaction; 32 infrequency of purchase; 33 26 Astra Pharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F. 2d 1201, 1206 (1st Cir. 1983). 27 Search sophistication, as formulated by Barton Beebe, ? refers to the consumer‘ s capacity to distinguish between similar trademark uses (i. e., to avoid identity confusion), and furthermore, to recognize that such uses designate different sources (i. e., to avoid inferential confusion).?

As explained in further detail below, the case law elaborating these considerations is based on an ad hoc, impressionistic conception of sophistication; the courts have never articulated anything approaching a rigorous, theoretical understanding of consumer care. Yet the perceived degree of sophistication can often be the factor that dictates the degree of protection afforded by law to a trademark holder. Some courts have gone so far as to suggest that a high degree of consumer sophistication in a target market may trump all other factors, virtually eliminating the likelihood of consumer confusion in the case of a professional or highly sophisticated buyer. 38 Other courts are much more measured in their assessment of the relative significance of this factor, suggesting that its ? import? is ? small indeed? (at least in cases where the junior and senior trademarks are ? identical?). 39 In assessing the significance of consumer care or sophistication, at least one court has suggested a distinction between source confusion and confusion as to 33 See infra text accompanying notes 217– 20. 34 See infra text accompanying notes 258– 318. 35 See infra text accompanying notes 222– 56. 36 See id. 37 See infra text accompanying notes 319– 30. 38 Sara Lee Corp. v.

Y. 1977) (stating that ?[ t] he Second Circuit has noted that the importance of this criterion is minimal where the marks in question are identical?). As to the empirical question of whether (and to what extent) the sophistication factor actually does affect the outcomes of the cases, Professor Beebe has concluded that this is the only ? non- core? factor that correlates significantly with judicial outcomes. Beebe, supra note 13, at 1612, 1642– 43 (identifying as ? non- core? factors ? purchaser sophistication, similarity of advertising/ marketing, similarity of sales facilities, and likelihood of bridging the gap?). Specifically, Beebe concludes that a ? finding that the consumer sophistication factor disfavors a likelihood of confusion correlates fairly strongly with an overall finding of no likelihood of confusion,? id. at 1612, but that ? the Second Circuit is significantly less likely than other circuits to find that the consumer sophistication factor disfavors a likelihood of confusion,? id. at 1643. Beebe‘ s study confirms the practical significance of this factor, while also indicating that its significance may vary by circuit. His data, however, say little about whether the sophistication factor should count in the likelihood of confusion inquiry, or, importantly, how its significance may vary depending on the relative strength of the parties‘ proof on other factors. Our analysis does not offer any empirical answer to this important question, but we do offer some theoretical analysis infra Part IV. B. 582 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 sponsorship.

A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODEL OF ? SOPHISTICATION?: MOTIVATION AND ABILITY AS FACTORS INFLUENCING COGNITIVE EFFORT The legal touchstone of trademark infringement boils down to a fundamental matter of consumer psychology. 47 As such, this legal standard should be shaped by a careful, informed analysis of consumer behavior, not by stereotypes and generalizations about the informed ? sovereign? or complete ? fool.? Thus, a careful investigation of the literature in this field is warranted. Firms often attempt to differentiate their products from the similar offerings of competitors. 48 For example, a firm selling gasoline to consumers may add proprietary detergents and performance enhancements to the gasoline in an attempt to differentiate it from other gasolines. Typically, a firm attempting to differentiate its product will ? brand? the product with a trademark. When a consumer is faced with a variety of differentiated products in a marketplace, the consumer will try to discern which products would suit her needs better than others. If the consumer finds a familiar brand in the marketplace, the consumer can identify the source of the product and infer the product‘ s attributes and quality much more quickly than if the consumer laboriously investigates the product to determine its attributes and quality. 49 For example, a motorist seeking gasoline need not do an in- depth analysis of the quality of a gasoline if it is sold under a brand name the consumer knows and respects. Before the consumer can use the brand as a shortcut for judging the attributes and quality of a product encountered in the marketplace, she must first identify the product‘ s brand. That is to say, the consumer must ascertain the identity of the source of the product (a judgment we refer to hereafter as the 46 SecuraComm Consulting, Inc., 984 F. Supp. at 299 (finding a likelihood of confusion in the junior‘ s use of the SECURACOM mark in competition with plaintiff‘ s SECURACOMM mark). 47 See Mishawaka v. S. S. Kresge, 316 U. S. 203, 205 (1942) (? The protection of trade- marks is the law‘ s recognition of the psychological function of symbols.?); RICHARD L. KIRKPATRICK, LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION IN TRADEMARK LAW, at xx (2005) (asserting that ? the question of trademark infringement is primarily one of the psychology— cognitive and behavioral— of consumers?). 48 See Byron Sharp & John Dawes, What Is Differentiation and How Does It Work?, 17 J. MARKETING MGMT. 739, 739 (2001) (? Differentiation is an old concept and one that is very basic to modern views of markets and marketing . . . .?). 49 Jacoby, supra note 14, at 1025. 584 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 ? source- identification judgment?). 50 The role of brands as shortcuts for evaluating quality when products are differentiated suggests that consumers will not always perform source- identification judgments. If the consumer believes competing products are undifferentiated, the brand‘ s identity does not add useful information to the consumer‘ s decision, so she is unlikely to perform the source- identification judgment. For example, a consumer who believes that ? all ketchup is the same? is unlikely to bother making a source- identification judgment when purchasing ketchup. Furthermore, if the consumer believes that product quality can be fully and easily judged, a shortcut for product evaluation is not useful to the consumer, so she is unlikely to perform the source- identification judgment. For example, a consumer purchasing meat may consider USDA grading to be a sufficient indicator that the meat is safe to consume and accurately labeled, making brand irrelevant. Arguably, brand name is relevant for the vast majority of consumer purchases. Even products that were once seen as undifferentiated (e. g., gasoline, ketchup, coffee, pickles, bath soap, and water) have been differentiated and branded. 51 Furthermore, in the absence of a certification mark (e. g., USDA grading for meats, Underwriters Laboratories for portable electronic tools, U. S. Coast Guard for life jackets), consumers often find it difficult to fully evaluate product quality without thorough physical inspection, purchase, and consumption. Because brands are so often relevant to consumer purchases, consumers typically perform a source- identification judgment when they consider products. 52 50 Under a longstanding rule of trademark law, the consumer‘ s ? identification? of the source need not extend to an awareness of the actual name of the manufacturer or distributor of the products in question. See 15 U. S. C. § 1127 (2006) (defining a ? trademark? as ? any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof—(1) used by a person; or (2) which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register established by this chapter, to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown?) (emphasis added). Thus, when we speak of the source- identification judgment, we refer to the trademark law concept of the consumer concluding that products bearing the same trademark come from a common— even if anonymous— source. See MCCARTHY, supra note 2, § 3: 7 (? However, the = identification‘ function of marks does not mean that the consumer must know the identity of the manufacturer or distributor of the goods. Seeing the same mark on goods merely identifies to the buyer the fact that all such goods come from a common, even though anonymous, source.?). 51 KEVIN LANE KELLER, STRATEGIC BRAND MANAGEMENT: BUILDING, MEASURING, AND MANAGING BRAND EQUITY 11 (Prentice Hall 2003) (1998). 52 As Jack Jacoby has explained, ? brand names serve as information = chunks,‘? in that they ? represent core nodes in memory around which other = associated‘ information is connected and organized.? Jacoby, supra note 14, at 1024. Thus, ?[ g] iven only a familiar brand name, a host of relevant and important information can be efficiently called into consciousness.? Id. at 1024– 25. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 585 This is not to suggest that consumers always perform the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly. 53 According to the theories developed in the consumer behavior literature, a consumer attempting to avoid source confusion by making a source- identification judgment must perform a series of steps. First, the consumer must gather product information that she considers of potential relevance to the source- identification judgment. 54 Such information might include the trademark itself, trade dress, and the price at which the product is being offered. Second, the consumer must comprehend the information— that is, consider the information to determine its meaning. 55 Whereas some types of information (such as brief and simple written descriptions) are easily comprehended by most consumers, others (such as numeric56 and technical57 data) are more difficult for most consumers to comprehend. Third, the consumer must identify the implications of the environmental information and integrate the implications to form the source- identification judgment. 58 To perform the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly, the consumer will form an initial hypothesis (i. e., an initial judgment) concerning the source of the product and then will consider further information in an attempt to validate the initial hypothesis. If the initial hypothesis is not supported by the new information, the process is repeated until the consumer forms a source- identification in which she is sufficiently confident. Each of the three steps of the source- identification judgment is a mental or cognitive process. That is, each step takes place in the mind of the consumer. One of the main tenets of the consumer psychology literature is that such 53 Nor do we mean to imply that source- identification will be relevant to every consumer. As explained infra Part IV, not every consumer who is equally motivated to engage in effortful cognition can be expected to direct her cognitive resources at the source- identification judgment. Thus, although we adopt the simplifying assumption here that brand names will be relevant to most consumer purchases, we relax that assumption in our broader critique of the law infra Part IV. 54 See Keller, supra note 51, at 9 (proposing brand identification within consumption choice situations constitutes a source- identity judgment); see also Joel B. Cohen & Kunal Basu, Alternative Models of Categorization: Toward a Contingent Processing Framework, 13 J. CONSUMER RES. 455, 455 (1987) (proposing that brand identification is a categorization judgment, which requires information search about the product at hand). 55 See JAMES R. BETTMAN, AN INFORMATION PROCESSING THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 29 (1979). 56 Richard F. Yalch & Rebecca Elmore- Yalch, The Effect of Numbers on the Route to Persuasion, 11 J.

MARKETING 57, 59– 61 (1980). 58 Cohen & Basu, supra note 54, at 456. 586 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 mental processes require cognitive effort. 59 Just as physical activity (e. g., climbing stairs) requires physical effort, so mental activity (e. g., searching the environment for information) requires cognitive effort. Therefore, a consumer can make the source- identification judgment in a thorough and vigilant manner only by expending ample cognitive effort. If she fails to devote sufficient cognitive effort to the source- identification task, it can be expected that she will gather inadequate environmental information, will not attempt to comprehend information that is difficult to comprehend, and will perform the source- identification judgment in a haphazard and offhand way. Presumably, if a consumer performs the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly, she is unlikely to suffer source confusion. 60 However, if she performs the judgment in a haphazard and thoughtless manner, she may not consider the differences between the junior and senior trademarks. As a result, she will be vulnerable to source confusion. 61 Therefore, one determinant of an individual consumer‘ s likelihood of confusion is the extent to which she expends cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment. Fortunately, consumer psychology researchers have given a great deal of research attention to identifying the antecedents of an individual consumer‘ s exertion of cognitive effort. The first broad category of antecedents relates to the individual‘ s motivation to expend cognitive effort. Just as people are typically reluctant to exert physical effort (e. g., people using escalators instead of climbing stairs) but will do so if they are sufficiently motivated, so people will exert cognitive effort only if they are sufficiently motivated. In effect, consumers act as cognitive misers62 who exert cognitive effort only when they 59 Yalch & Elmore- Yalch, supra note 56, at 526; see also Ellen C. Garbarino & Julie A. Edell, Cognitive Effort, Affect, and Choice, 24 J. CONSUMER RES. 147, 147– 48 (1997) (discussing two different studies examining the relationship between consumer psychology and cognitive effort). 60 This is not to suggest that a consumer who performs the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly cannot be confused. If the junior and senior trademarks are identical, not even a thorough and vigilant inspection by the consumer will prevent source confusion. Furthermore, recent research findings suggest that if two trademarks have the same semantic meaning, consumers who exert a high degree of care may be more confused than consumers who exert a low degree of care. See Daniel J. Howard et al., The Effects of Brand Name Similarity on Brand Source Confusion: Implications for Trademark Infringement, 19 J. PUB. POL‘ Y & MARKETING 250, 261 (2000). 61 Jean- Noel Kapferer, Brand Confusion: Empirical Study of a Legal Concept, 12 PSYCHOL. & MARKETING 551, 554 (1995). 62 See Michael J. Houston et al., Picture- Word Consistency and the Elaborative Processing of Advertisements, 24 J. MARKETING RES. 359, 360 (1987) (showing the role of elaborative processing during advertising exposure); see also Alice H. Eagly & Shelly Chaiken, Attitude Structure and Function, in 1 THE 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 587 have sufficient incentive to do so. 63 The second broad category of antecedents is the individual‘ s ability to exert cognitive effort. 64 Just as people may be inhibited in their ability to perform a physical task (e. g., the stairs are particularly steep or the climber has an arthritic knee), so customers can be restricted in their ability to exert cognitive effort as they perform the judgment at hand. Motivation and ability are each necessary but insufficient conditions for an individual to exert cognitive effort. That is, if either motivation or ability is lacking, the individual will exert little cognitive effort while performing a judgment task. Thus, consumer behavior literature suggests that if a consumer is to perform the source- identification judgment in a meticulous and vigilant manner, she must be sufficiently motivated and able to exert the cognitive effort necessary to perform such a judgment. 65 In contrast, if an individual lacks either motivation or ability to expend cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, she will perform the task in a haphazard and offhand manner, resulting in an increased likelihood of confusion. Viewed through this theoretical lens, the legal concept of the ? degree of consumer care? considered by the courts is similar to the notion described in the consumer behavior literature as the level of exerted cognitive effort. The courts have generally held that if consumers exercise a low degree of care, likelihood of confusion in the marketplace will be increased. 66 Consumer psychology theory supports the same prediction: If an individual consumer HANDBOOK OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 269, 292 (Daniel Todd Gilbert et al. eds., 4th ed. 1993) (describing the role of selective attention and perception processes in allocation of limited cognitive resources to salient environmental stimuli); James M. Olson & Mark P. Zanna, Attitudes and Attitude Change, 44 ANN. REV. PSYCHOL. 117, 135– 36 (1993) (discussing research confirming that consumers engage in the minimum amount of deliberation necessary to provide themselves with sufficient judgmental confidence when making consumption choices). 63 A pejorative reading (i. e., consumers are cognitively lazy and therefore corrupt and deficient) is unnecessary. By expending physical effort only when motivated to do so, humans conserve energy and thereby hold in reserve the energy to act when necessary. An individual who continually expends maximum physical effort at every possible opportunity would expend mostly unnecessary effort and would probably be unable to survive. The same can be said for cognitive effort; if the many judgments an individual makes during a typical day were made with maximum vigilance and thoroughness, the individual would be unable to function effectively. 64 See Noel Capon & Roger Davis, Basic Cognitive Ability Measures as Predictors of Consumer Information Processing Strategies, 11 J. CONSUMER RES. 551, 552 (1984). 65 See supra note 62. 66 See supra notes 25– 30. 588 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 exerts little cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, the individual is more likely to experience source confusion. 67 This analysis can be employed to refine the terminology employed in the case law. ? Sophistication? and ? consumer care? are used almost interchangeably by the courts, 68 but the terms are not precisely synonymous. Instead, sophistication is an antecedent of consumer care. Consumers can be said to be ? sophisticated? when they have both the motivation and ability to exercise a high degree of consumer care when performing the source- identification judgment. Thus a ? sophisticated? consumer emerges from the confluence of motivation and ability. In the sub- sections below, we explain the considerations identified in the consumer behavior literature as relevant to consumer motivation and ability to process information carefully. For clarity of exposition here, the elements of the model are illustrated in Figure 1 below (with outline headings that correspond to the sub- sections that expand on these elements below). 67 See Howard et al., supra note 60, at 261. 68 See, e. g., Kellogg Co. v. Toucan Golf, Inc., 337 F. 3d 616, 623 (6th Cir. 2003) (characterizing this factor as ? the probable degree of purchaser care and sophistication?); Bristol- Myers Squibb Co. v. McNeil- P. P.

Motivation to Exercise Consumer Care We first turn our attention to motivation for consumer care. There are both situational and intrapersonal factors that work to increase or decrease consumer motivation to exercise care. One key antecedent of motivation is a consumer‘ s level of involvement with the purchase or consumption situation. Another component of motivation— referred to in the literature as ? need for cognition? 69— is an enduring, intrapersonal trait that can directly influence a consumer‘ s motivation for care. We first detail the influence a consumer‘ s 69 John T. Cacioppo & Richard E. Petty, The Need for Cognition, 42 J. PERSONALITY & SOC. PSYCHOL. 116, 116 (1982).

Involvement In consumer research, a consumer‘ s level of product involvement is a heavily researched construct directly related to the consumer‘ s motivation to expend cognitive effort. 70 The perception of personal relevance or salience is the essential characteristic of involvement. 71 Consumers experience a psychological state of cognitive arousal referred to as high ? felt? involvement when they perceive a connection between themselves and the product, the brand, the product category, the consumption activity, or the purchase situation. 72 Highly involved consumers are highly motivated to exercise consumer care during the source- identification judgment. In contrast, many consumers perceive little connection between themselves and a product, which can be said to constitute a low level of involvement. Routine repurchases and impulse buys for low- cost items are prototypical examples of low- involvement situations. Low levels of felt involvement will not motivate a consumer to exercise consumer care. This does not suggest that consumers with low felt- involvement will necessarily have low motivation; other factors (as described below) can influence motivation. Thus, what can be said is that that high levels of felt involvement increase motivation and low levels of felt involvement fail to increase motivation. 73 As developed in the consumer behavior literature, 74 there are two types of felt involvement: enduring involvement and situational involvement. As described below, the two types of involvement differ in terms of their antecedents and their consequences. 70 For an extensive review, see PIRJO LAAKSONEN, CONSUMER INVOLVEMENT: CONCEPTS AND RESEARCH (1994). 71 Richard L. Celsi & Jerry C. Olson, The Role of Involvement in Attention and Comprehension Processes, 15 J. CONSUMER RES. 210, 211 (1988). 72 Herbert E.

Jain ed., 1978) (introducing the bifurcated situational/ enduring involvement framework). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 591 a. Enduring Involvement A consumer is said to have enduring involvement in a product that she is simply ? into?— whether by way of a hobby, an occupation, or some other enduring interest. 75 Such enduring involvement transcends any one specific encounter with the product (such as the purchase situation) and motivates consumers across multiple product experiences and interactions. To give one example, Harley Davidson customers often have high enduring involvement— to the extent that their fixation and interest in the product and brand is based on their trans- situational interest in the product and its associated lifestyle. For such customers, Harley Davidson is a brand closely related to their personal identity and sense of self76 and, as such, acts as an intrinsic source of personal relevance77 that predisposes them to the experience of felt involvement across time and in varied contexts. 78 The expected universe of products for which any given consumer has high enduring involvement is relatively small. 79 b. Situational Involvement and Perceived Risk In contrast to enduring involvement, situational involvement is cued by the purchase situation, including those elements of the situation that are directly related to the perceived risk of purchasing and consuming the product. 80 Ceteris paribus, as a consumer perceives higher levels of risk in a purchase, she experiences higher levels of situational involvement81 and is, therefore, motivated to exercise greater consumer care during the source- identification judgment. 75 See Celsi & Olson, supra note 71, at 212. 76 See John W.

CONSUMER RES. 119, 120 (1986) (showing that consumers engage in greater and more careful product search when involvement is high). 592 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 An important distinction must be made between perceived risk and objective risk. All that is necessary to bring about situational involvement is for the consumer to perceive risk. 82 Whether the consumer‘ s risk perceptions are objectively correct is irrelevant. For example, if most consumers perceive little or no physical risk associated with the purchase and use of a new outdoor grill, expert testimony indicating that injuries related to outdoor grills are, in fact, commonplace would be irrelevant to situational involvement. For the same reason, commonly experienced consumer fears lead to perceptions of risk, even if those fears are irrational or objectively unfounded. Several types of perceived risk have been identified in the literature as impacting situational involvement. 83 For example, situational involvement increases when consumers perceive a heightened physical risk (i. e., risk of bodily harm) in either the purchase or use of a product or service. 84 Additionally, perceptions of performance risk increase when there is greater uncertainty about whether a product will perform as expected. 85 Such perceptions are often related to product quality considerations. When a product is relatively expensive (a perception that depends on the relationship between the price and the customer‘ s available funds), consumers‘ perceptions of financial risk increase. Thus, consumers buying an automobile typically perceive financial risk because the purchase is a large percentage of their households‘ disposable income. Time risk reflects the expected duration of the purchase process and the perceived length of ownership. 86 As the perceptions of the time horizon of ownership expands, so too does the perceived risk associated with the purchase situation. Thus, for most people, buying a durable good, such as a dishwasher, is situationally involving not only because it is relatively expensive, but also because consumers expect to live with the product for several years. Finally, social risk relates to the possible negative reactions of other people if the consumer purchases or consumes the product. 87 Because a gift- giver is typically trying to please another person, gift- giving inherently carries high social risk. Likewise, if a consumer judges that harm 82 See Vincent- Wayne Mitchell, Consumer Perceived Risk: Conceptualizations & Models, 33 EUROPEAN J. MARKETING, 163, 163– 95 (1995) (discussing the relationship between perceived risk and the level of consumer involvement and trust, as well as the various models used to measure this relationship). 83 See Jacob Jacoby & Leon Kaplan, The Components of Perceived Risk, in 3 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RESEARCH, 382, 383 (M. Venkatesan ed., 1972); Ted Roselius, Consumer Rankings of Risk Reduction Methods, 35 J. MARKETING 56, 58 (1971). 84 Jacoby & Kaplan, supra note 83, at 383. 85 Id. 86 Roselius, supra note 83, at 58. 87 Jacoby & Kaplan, supra note 83, at 383. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 593 will come to her social standing if the wrong product is chosen (e. g., if she buys eyeglasses that are long out of style), then social risk is said to be high. In general, when the purchase or consumption of goods or services is interpersonally open to display, perceptions of social risk increase. 88 A high level of any of these five perceived risks causes consumers to be situationally involved and, therefore, motivated to exercise consumer care while making product judgments. In effect, the consumer carefully deliberates product judgments in the hope that the perceived risks of the buying situation will be mitigated. 2. Intrapersonal Trait Influences on Motivation The consumer psychology literature also suggests that consumers have traits that consistently impact motivation to exert cognitive effort across a variety of situations. For example, some consumers just enjoy thinking more than others. It is part of who they are. Research has identified among such consumers a high ? need for cognition.? 89 Consumers with a high need for cognition enjoy thinking deeply. They derive ? intrinsic enjoyment? from ? engaging in effortful information processing.? 90 They tend to exert cognitive effort to carefully consider consumer problems (e. g., carefully considering the attributes and benefits of a product before purchasing it). 91 On the other hand, consumers with a low need for cognition do not enjoy exerting cognitive effort and tend to avoid exerting such effort whenever possible, preferring instead to rely on their intuitions and emotions as their guides. It must be emphasized that need for cognition is a motivational variable, not an ability variable. It is not necessarily the case that consumers in high need for cognition are more intelligent92 than their low need for cognition counterparts. 93 Consumers high 88 See, e. g., Cornelia Pechmann et al., What to Convey in Antismoking Advertisements for Adolescents: The Use of Protective Motivation Theory to Identify Effective Message Themes, 67 J. MARKETING 1, 1– 18 (2003) (showing that anti- smoking advertisements showing severe social disapproval of smoking are more effective in curbing underage smoking than those that do not). 89 Cacioppo & Petty, supra note 69, at 116. 90 John T.

Haugtvedt et al., Need for Cognition and Advertising: Understanding the Role of Personality Variables in Consumer Behavior, 1 J. CONSUMER PSYCHOL. 239, 247 (1992). 92 Intelligence, as will be discussed in a subsequent section, relates to ability to exert consumer care. See infra text accompanying notes 101– 37. 93 See John T. Cacioppo et al., Dispositional Differences in Cognitive Motivation: The Life and Times of Individuals Varying in Need for Cognition, 119 PSYCHOL. BULL. 197, 207 (1996) (noting that correlations between the need for cognition and measures of intellectual ability have proved to be quite low, ranging from - 0.03 to 0.32). 594 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 in need for cognition do, however, enjoy cognition and thus are relatively more motivated to engage in extended thought. Relating the need for cognition to the idea of cognitive misers discussed previously, 94 it can be said that individuals who are high in need for cognition are less miserly in their exertion of cognitive effort than individuals who are low in need for cognition. Need for cognition is a stable intrapersonal trait variable that has a reliable influence on a person‘ s motivation to allocate cognitive effort. Research suggests that as compared to consumers who are low in need for cognition, those who are high in need for cognition engage more thoroughly in information search95 regarding potential purchases and respond differently to advertising and other persuasive campaigns. 96 Consumers high in need for cognition tend to focus on substantive message components in advertisements and ignore extraneous information, such as attractive photographs, humor, and celebrity spokespeople. 97 Thus, a consumer‘ s need for cognition is an enduring trait predisposition that likely correlates in general terms with Barton Beebe‘ s notion of ? search? sophistication. 98 Consumers high in need for cognition search for information more extensively and process the information they find more carefully. 99 Need for cognition is of legal relevance because consumers differing in their need for cognition can be expected to have differing product interests. For example, consumers high in need for cognition may gravitate toward products and consumption experiences that provide opportunities for the exertion of cognitive effort, such as chess, strategy games, educational experiences and television shows like Jeopardy. 100 Because a high need for cognition is likely commonplace among consumers of such products, motivation for care will be relatively higher in markets of such product categories, thus reducing (ceteris paribus) the likelihood of confusion. 94 See supra text accompanying note 62. 95 Bas Verplanken et al., Need for Cognition and External Information Search Effort, 26 J.

MACINNIS, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 381 (4th ed. 2007). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 595 B. Ability to Exercise Consumer Care As noted above, high motivation is a necessary but insufficient condition for a consumer to exercise a high degree of care when performing the source- identification judgment. The other necessary but insufficient condition is the consumer‘ s ability to exercise consumer care. As with the motivational construct, and as presented in Figure 1, both situational and intrapersonal factors influence a consumer‘ s ability to exercise consumer care and thereby influence the likelihood that an individual consumer will suffer from source confusion. Situational influences on ability are discussed under the rubric of ? opportunity,? whereas intrapersonal trait influences on ability are denominated ? capacity? and ? capability.? Ability is generally defined in the consumer behavior literature as the extent to which the consumer has available the cognitive resources requisite to exercise consumer care during information processing and decision making. 101 To claim that the consumer‘ s ability is high is to assert that when making the source- identification judgment, the consumer is capable of gathering whatever information is desired, capable of comprehending and considering the information, and capable of exerting the cognitive effort necessary to systematically and thoroughly make the source- identification judgment. If the consumer‘ s ability is low, she will be inhibited in her ability to exercise consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 102 1. Situational Influences on Ability: Opportunity Situational factors that constrain the ability of consumers to engage in extended cognition, and thus exercise consumer care, include distracting environments, limited information, limited opportunities for comparison, incomprehensible information, and restrictions on time. 103 Concomitantly, multiple exposures to relevant information across decision experiences can enhance consumers‘ opportunities to exercise consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 104 101 See, e. g., Deborah J. Maclnnis & Bernard J. Jaworski, Information Processing from Advertisements: Toward an Integrative Framework, 53 J. MARKETING 1, 6– 7 (1989). 102 Id. at 7. 103 Id. 104 Id. 596 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 a. Distracting Environments Distraction is any aspect of the purchase environment that diverts cognitive resources and attention away from pertinent information. 105 Background music can act as a distraction that inhibits opportunity to engage in extended thought. 106 For example, as a consumer at a bar attempts to choose from a long list of lagers, she may be distracted by the bar‘ s loud music. Similarly, loud noise and physical discomfort, such as illness, misbehaving children, and scents in the air, 107 can all act as distractions in a purchasing environment. Also, aggressive salespeople often distract consumers from the opportunity for thought afforded by a self- paced information search and deliberation by interrupting with questions and conversation. 108 The result of such distractions is that consumers have less opportunity to exercise consumer care during the source- identification judgment, thereby increasing the likelihood of source confusion. 109 b. Limited Information Purchase environments may also limit the opportunity of consumers to gather information that would be relevant to the source- identification judgment, thereby reducing the opportunity to effectively perform the judgment. 110 For example, when making in- home purchases (e. g., as with e- commerce), buyers cannot physically inspect the item before purchase. Similarly, some types of retail display cases inhibit physical inspection. 111 Physical inspection is the primary way of obtaining information for products 105 Scott B.

CONSUMER RES. 83, 83– 92 (1992); see also Stephen B. Castleberry & C. David Shepherd, Effective Interpersonal Listening and Personal Selling, 13 J. PERSONAL SELLING & SALES MGMT. 35, 36 (1993) (describing effective salespeople as those who exhibit good listening skills, including an avoidance of interrupting customers). 109 See MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 7. 110 See id. 111 Joann Peck & Terry L. Childers, To Have and to Hold: The Influence of Haptic Information on Product Judgments, 67 J MARKETING 35, 36 (2003). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 597 that vary in terms of material properties, such as texture and weight. 112 For example, the scent of perfume and the weight balance of running shoes are physical attributes best evaluated by the consumer‘ s physical examination of the product. Such physical information may strongly indicate source identity, so preventing the gathering of such information can inhibit consumers from effectively making the source- identification judgment. c. Limited Opportunity to Compare Information Consumers may also be inhibited in their opportunity to compare information about the junior and senior trademarks. Limited retail distribution makes such inhibition commonplace. 113 If a retailer offers for sale items bearing both the junior and senior trademark, shoppers will have ample opportunity to compare the items ? side by side,? while making a source- identification judgment. If, however, the retailer offers for sale only the junior trademark, shoppers are inhibited in their opportunity to compare the junior and senior trademarks, thus reducing shoppers‘ opportunity to exercise care when making the source- identification judgment. For example, if a consumer shops at a retailer that offers for sale Converz shoes, but not Converse shoes, the consumer will be less able to compare information about the junior and the senior trademarks and will, therefore, be less able to exert consumer care (as compared to a consumer shopping at a retailer that sells both Converz and Converse shoes). d. Incomprehensible Information Even if product information is readily available, consumers will be inhibited in their opportunity to process the information if it is presented in a way that is difficult to comprehend. 114 For example, even if the product labeling on the junior trademark explicitly describes differences between it and 112 See Joann Peck & Jennifer Wiggins, It Just Feels Good: Customers? Affective Response to Touch and Its Influence on Persuasion, 70 J. MARKETING 56, 56– 57 (2006) (describing the important role physical characteristics of the product play in communicating salient information about the product such as the gel finger- grip on the Paper Mate Dynagrip pen). 113 See MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 3, 7 (describing the essential role of opportunity in product evaluation); see also Beatty & Smith, supra note 81, at 84 (showing that greater retail distribution enhances opportunity information search and comparative evaluation while limited retail distribution impedes opportunity); Guliz Ger, Richard Belk & Dana- Nicoleta Lascu, The Development of Consumer Desire in Marketing and Developing Economies, 20 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RES. 102, 107 (1993) (describing that when products and brands are scarcely distributed, information is limited and opportunity for processing is inhibited). 114 MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 7. 598 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 the senior trademark, if the label contains obscure technical jargon (common with products such as home theater equipment), numeric data (common with products such as dietary supplements), 115 or a foreign language (common with products such as French perfumes), the consumer will have reduced opportunity to perform the source- identification judgment. e. Restrictions on Time Harried consumers under time pressure will have limited opportunity to carefully consider product information. 116 Consumer research has shown that time- pressured consumers use shallow, heuristic processing and consider a more limited array of product information. 117 Opportunity is also limited by time when information is presented in short bursts and limited- duration windows, 118 and when consumers cannot control their own rate of exposure to information (as with ads playing on radio and television). 119 f. Frequency of Exposure In contrast to the many situational factors that can act to inhibit opportunity, 120 one situational factor acts to increase opportunity: multiple exposures to relevant information. 121 For example, seeing an advertisement or a retail display multiple times increases the opportunity for the information to be considered while the consumer performs the source- identification judgment. Also, if there are many overt steps required to enact a purchase, the opportunity for exposure to relevant information is increased. For example, if a consumer desires to purchase a prescription drug after viewing a direct- to- consumer advertisement sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, the 115 Richard F.

Each step in the purchase process gives the consumer more opportunity to make (and refine) a source- identification judgment. 2. Intrapersonal Influences on Ability: Capacity and Capability Beyond situational influences on consumers‘ ability to exercise consumer care, a customer comes to a purchase situation with traits that can either enable or inhibit her ability. This intrapersonal, enduring cognitive ability can be bifurcated in an important way: capacity and capability to exercise consumer care. To understand these distinctions more clearly, it is useful to think of capacity as a ? hardware? aspect of cognition and capability as ? software.? 122 The ? hardware? aspect, like a computer, refers to the state or capacity ? of the machine?— how much processing power or ability does the consumer bring to a purchase situation? 123 Some computers simply have faster hardware than others. The ? software? aspect, as the metaphor suggests, refers to the existence of past experience, knowledge structures, memories, and expertise available to the consumer when exerting cognitive effort as part of mental processes. 124 In this sense, capability as ? software? refers to the memory structures the mind can use to compare, contrast, counter argue, confirm, integrate, and, in other ways, elaborate upon during the consumer decisionmaking process. 125 a. Capacity for Exercising Consumer Care: “ Hardware” Consumer behavior studies suggest that intelligence, education, and age are all directly related to a person‘ s capacity to exercise consumer care. Higher levels of intelligence endow the consumer with greater processing capacity. 126 Further, much like an upgrade in hardware processing power, greater educational attainment is shown to advance intelligence by improving processing strategies, problem- solving skills, and the ability to parse and apprehend complex information. 127 122 Arie W. Kruglanski et al., Separate or Equal?: Bimodal Notions of Persuasion and a Single Process “ Unimodel,” in DUAL- PROCESS THEORIES IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 293, 298– 99 (Shelly Chaiken & Yaacov Trope eds., 1999). 123 Id. at 299. 124 Id. at 298. 125 Id. 126 See Rolph E. Anderson & Marvin A. Jolson, Technical Wording in Advertising: Implications for Market Segmentation, 44 J.

EDUC., 17, 17– 18 (2007). 600 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 Age has also been correlated with cognitive capacity, but in a non- monotonic way. The consumer behavior literature suggests that cognitive capacity increases from childhood to adulthood, but eventually declines due to the effects of aging. 128 Graphically, the relationship can be expressed in an ? inverted U- curve? as cognitive capacity for elaborative processing is plotted against cognitive development. The cognitive abilities of young children are still developing, giving them reduced capacity to apprehend and consider market information. 129 Furthermore, elderly consumers have been shown to commonly experience diminished cognitive skills and thus a reduced capacity to process market information. 130 b. Capability for Exercising Consumer Care: “ Software” Continuing the metaphor introduced earlier, the ? software? aspects of innate cognitive skill relate to a consumer‘ s capability to exercise consumer care. ? Capability refers to the knower‘ s possession of active cognitive structures (i. e., knowledge structures available in memory) wherein the reasoning process from evidence to conclusion may be carried out.? 131 Thus, having relatively more extensive knowledge of a particular product or product category (i. e., greater consumer expertise132) provides an individual‘ s processing- ability ? hardware? something to relate to the information in the environment. 133 In fact, having previous experience with and knowledge of a product and its product category facilitates the acquisition of new information regarding that product and category, while also increasing the efficiency134 and accuracy135 of the information search. 128 See, e. g., Yany Gregoire, The Impact of Aging on Consumer Responses: What Do We Know?, 30 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RES. 19, 22 (2003). 129 Id. at 19. 130 Catherine A.

CONSUMER RES. 190, 190– 207 (1993). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 601 Individuals develop more elaborate knowledge structures around what they experience more frequently. 136 On this point, the situational influence of repeated encounters with relevant market information (e. g., during consumer decisions that require multiple steps to complete) interacts with the development of knowledge structures to facilitate the performance of the source- identification judgment. Thus, consumers who purchase the same product frequently have greater knowledge in that category, which amounts to an increase in capability. Similarly, consumers exposed to repeated advertising are more likely to develop richer product knowledge structures that are facilitative of consumer care. 137 In sum, the consumer behavior literature suggests that if an individual lacks either motivation or ability to expend cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, she will perform the judgment in a haphazard and offhand manner, resulting in an increased likelihood of confusion. A consumer may be motivated to exercise a high degree of care by any one of a number of factors: enduring involvement, situational involvement (precipitated by risk perceptions), or need for cognition. A consumer‘ s ability to exercise a high degree of care may be inhibited by distractions in the shopping environment, limited availability of information, limited opportunity to compare the junior and senior trademarks, incomprehensible information, and restrictions on time. Conversely, a consumer‘ s ability can be increased through multiple exposures to product information and a multiple- step purchase process. As described in the next Part, these principles allow detailed predictions regarding the circumstances in which consumers can be expected to experience source confusion. III. THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODEL AS A CONSTRUCT FOR EVALUATING JUDICIAL CONCEPTIONS OF CONSUMER SOPHISTICATION AND CARE The judicial evaluation of consumer ? care? and ? sophistication? has not, as yet, tapped into the insights of the consumer behavior literature. Instead, the case law in this field has unfolded in an unsystematic, ad hoc manner, with the courts being guided by intuition and (eventually) precedent, and not by any comprehensive theoretical principles. Thus, there is a fundamental disconnect between a field of law that is premised on assumptions about consumer behavior and a well- developed body of literature studying those very 136 C. Whan Park et al., Consumer Knowledge Assessment, 21 J. CONSUMER RES. 71, 71 (1994). 137 See Alba & Hutchinson, supra note 132, at 415– 17. 602 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 assumptions. This is unfortunate, as the consumer behavior model provides powerful theoretical tools for understanding and analyzing judicial intimations about consumer sophistication. We seek to remedy this disconnect here. In the sections below, we evaluate some of the principal strands of the consumer sophistication case law through the lens of the consumer behavior model. The discussion proceeds on two levels. On some points, we offer a ? positive? analysis of the case law, which, though built on intuition and without any comprehensive theoretical foundation, turns out in many respects to find support in the consumer behavior model. To this extent, the contribution of our model is to provide a sound framework for understanding the existing case law and thus to facilitate its evolution and development over time. Second, in other instances, we find the case law‘ s intuitive assessments to be faulty, or at least shortsighted, and to this extent we offer a ? normative? analysis. On these issues, we propose a change in the direction of the current case law— a change that is necessary where sound theoretical principles contradict ad hoc judicial intuition. The sections below address several lines of cases in which the courts have evaluated the degree of consumer care or sophistication. Specifically, we consider cases in which the courts have identified price, length and complexity of the purchase transaction, frequency of purchase, education, age, and income as factors relevant to the expected degree of consumer care, as well as cases in which the target market consists of professional buyers or avid hobbyists. Our analysis of these cases demonstrates that the consumer is neither the ? fool,? as the apologist commentator would have it, nor the informed ? sovereign,? as the restrictionists posit. Instead, the consumer exhibits characteristics of both, depending on the circumstances. She devotes extensive cognitive energy to the source- identification judgment only where she is motivated and able to do so; where either or both of these preconditions are absent, her involvement in source- identification will be limited— not because she is a ? fool? or a ? presumptive idiot,? but because she is following the same human tendencies that we all possess. 138 138 See generally, Adam Benforado & Jon Hanson, The Great Attributional Divide: How Divergent Views of Human Behavior Are Shaping Legal Policy, 57 EMORY L. J. 311 (2008) (Discussing the causes and effects of these tendencies). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 603 A. Price The courts have long embraced the notion that consumer care is affected by price. Where ? goods or services are relatively expensive,? the courts anticipate that ? more care is taken? at the point of purchase and that ? buyers are less likely to be confused as to source or affiliation.? 139 As one court put it, ? the average purchaser of an automobile will no doubt devote more attention to examining different products and determining the manufacturer or source than will the average purchaser of a ball of twine.? 140 Examples of expensive items thought to indicate high consumer involvement include boats, 141 cameras, 142 high- end home exercise equipment, 143 guitars, 144 sound design services, 145 trade association memberships, 146 cruise ship tickets, 147 waste- water treatment devices, 148 mortgages, 149 golf club memberships, 150 and real estate. 151 Conversely, where the ? products are relatively low- priced and subject to impulse buying, the risk of likelihood of confusion is increased.? 152 For example, ? inexpensive snack foods? are expected to be ? purchased with little care? under circumstances where consumer confusion is likely. 153 By the same token, ?[ t] he ordinary purchaser of bread and margarine is a casual buyer,? 139 Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v.

According to this model, price is correlated positively with perceived financial risk. Thus, holding all other factors constant, as price increases so does situational involvement— an antecedent of the consumer‘ s motivation to exert consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. To this extent, the courts‘ intuitive assessment of the relevance of price rests on sound theoretical footing. That is not to say that the consumer behavior model supports the notion of designating price as a dispositive factor. While higher prices generally are thought to heighten perceptions of financial risk for most consumers, consumer behavior theory reveals that the level of involvement is not intrinsic to the product, but is relative to the consumer as the perceiver. In other words, involvement is in the eye of the consumer and not intrinsic to product or service per se. It is a bit of a misnomer to call an expensive good a ? high- involvement product.? Thus, the consumer behavior model suggests an important adjustment to the courts‘ treatment of price as a proxy for consumer sophistication. Under our model, price may correlate with the level of care exercised by the consumer, but only to the extent that the financial risk- factor identified in the involvement construct outweighs any other relevant involvement factors that may point in the other direction.

Y. 2003). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 605 would reinforce the usual correlation between price and consumer care. For certain products like apparel and jewelry, for example, high involvement may be cued not only because of the financial risks associated with high price, but also in light of the potential social risks presented. 163 For other products, like high- end climbing equipment, the involvement motivation flowing from the financial risks associated with a hefty price tag would be reinforced by physical risks. 164 In some situations and market segments, however, we might expect an expensive product to be a low- involvement purchase; in other circumstances, we might expect high involvement, even in the purchase of relatively inexpensive items. Even a low- priced item might rate high on the motivation scale, for example, if it presents significant physical risks. In situations where the use of the product or service may involve the potential for tangible harm, consumers generally will be more situationally involved and process relevant information more systematically and carefully. 165 In the following sections, we identify circumstances in which (1) even high- priced goods cannot be expected to engender sufficient levels of exercised care; and (2) low- priced goods might nonetheless produce incentives for exercised care. 1. High- Prices, Yet Insufficient Levels of Consumer Care Our model provides a framework for identifying circumstances where even high- priced goods may not be expected to produce consumer care that is sufficient to dispel confusion. First, high prices will trigger motivation for care only where they give rise to perceived financial risk. Thus, the significance of 163 See J. R. Wood & Sons v. Reese Jewelry Corp., 278 F. 2d 157, 159 (2d Cir. 1960) (finding sophistication on the part of consumers of wedding and engagement rings); see also E. T. F. Enters., Inc. v. Nina Ricci, S. A. R. L., 523 F. Supp. 1147, 1156 (S. D. N. Y. 1981) (asserting that fashion- conscious customers of clothing, fragrances, and accessories ? are not likely to be misled by two marks which share the same surname but have different first names?). 164 See S. Indus., Inc. v. Stone Age Equip., Inc., 12 F. Supp. 2d 796, 816 (N. D. Ill. 1998) (noting that ?[ s] electing a shoe to wear for climbing treacherous peaks . . . requires careful examination and inquiry about the sole‘ s gripping characteristics and ability to withstand these extraordinary uses,? and concluding that ? at $ 140 a pair, customers will not make the purchase lightly?); see also Bioglan Inc. v. Bioglan Labs. Ltd., 44 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1662, 1667 (C. D. Cal. 1997) (indicating that purchasers of healthcare- related products are likely to exercise some degree of care); Blansett Pharmacal Co. v. Carmrick Labs. Inc., 25 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1473, 1477 (T. T. A. B. 1992) (applying the ? doctrine of greater care? in asserting that it is more important to avoid confusion with respect to pharmaceuticals because of the potential for serious medical consequences). But see Eli Lilly & Co. v. Natural Answers, Inc., 233 F. 3d 456, 464 (7th Cir. 2000) (suggesting that ? there is just no evidence that consumers as a whole are extraordinarily careful when it comes to dietary supplements?). 165 See Celsi, supra note 84, at 1– 23 (detailing the extent of involvement exhibited by consumers purchasing and participating in high- physical- risk consumption). 606 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 price in the consumer- care function should be evaluated relative to the income or wealth of the target demographic. If a certain product is targeted at a particularly wealthy clientele, a price tag that might seem high to an average consumer— i. e., one that would generate perceived financial risk— may not have the same effect. 166 Second, even where a consumer‘ s perception of financial risk is high, the model does not predict a high level of consumer care where there are significant constraints on opportunity for care. After all, motivation is only one factor in the consumer care function; even a motivated consumer will not be careful if her ability to be careful is limited by environmental constraints. Consider the case of Karen J. Connelly, S. Y. K., LLC v. ValueVision Media, Inc., 167 where the court assessed the degree of care expected of consumers of jewelry sold through ? home shopping? television outlets. 168 Although the jewelry was ? not inexpensive (ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars),? the court nonetheless concluded that consumers of such items were not sophisticated. 169 The court based its conclusion on its understanding of the ? nature of home shopping, where consumers do not actually inspect items prior to purchase.? 170 This analysis can be translated in terms of our model in opportunity terms. The television home shopping context may be one in which a consumer‘ s motivation for enhanced involvement in a high- priced (and thus high- financial- risk) purchase might be overcome by the consumer‘ s reduced opportunity to gather information by physically inspecting the product prior to purchase, thus reducing their ability to engage in extended cognition. Thus, the home shopping buyer of jewelry may be sufficiently motivated to be careful, but constraints on opportunity may still give reason to rate the level of consumer care as relatively low. 171 166 At least one court has proffered the converse conclusion (albeit without pinpointing the issue as one of ? perceived risk?). See Reebok Intern. Ltd. v. K- Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 252, 268 (S. D. N. Y. 1994) (? In fact, an argument can be made that shoppers with limited budgets use more care in spending their more limited resources than shoppers at non- discount stores.?). 167 2004 WL 2569494 (D. Minn. Nov. 9, 2004). 168 Id. at * 1. 169 Id. at * 7. 170 Id. 171 As explained in greater detail infra notes 215– 16, there may be reason to be skeptical about the effect of such constraints on opportunity. The very context identified by the court— the home shopping environment in which ? consumers do not actually inspect items prior to purchase?— may further enhance a consumer‘ s motivation for extended cognition. Karen J. Connelly, S. Y. K., LLC, 2004 WL 2569494, at * 7. Specifically, in the context of a jewelry purchase in a home- shopping environment, the consumer has limited information about the product that she purchases, little confidence in or experience with the product, and an expectation of 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 607 Even where financial risk is not outweighed by other elements, the model identifies additional grounds for rejecting the usual presumption that high price will engender care sufficient to reduce the likelihood of confusion. Under the model, the exercise of consumer care is relevant only to the extent that the exertion of additional cognitive effort can be expected to dispel confusion. If it will not, as in a case involving identical marks in direct competition with each other, even a relatively high degree of consumer care will not be sufficient. This analysis explains decisions like Omega Importing Corp. v. Petri- Kine Camera Co., 172 in which the court found a likelihood of confusion arising out of the junior‘ s use of the EXAKTA trademark in direct competition with the senior‘ s use of the identical trademark on high- priced cameras. 173 Although the court acknowledged that ? the cameras here in question are expensive items? with respect to which the ? purchaser would be expected to make more than a casual inspection of the product before buying,? 174 the court found that ? purchaser inspection would be of doubtful value.? 175 This conclusion is consistent with our model. If even relatively high levels of cognition cannot dispel confusion between facially identical trademarks, then high price is simply beside the point. 2. Low- Prices, but High Levels of Consumer Care Sometimes, even low- priced goods can rate high on the involvement scale, such as in cases where alternative considerations introduce ? perceived risk? beyond that associated with high price. Worthington Foods v. Kellogg Co. 176 arguably presents one example. In that case, the court concluded that ? heightened awareness of health and healthy foods raises the standard of care which the reasonable purchaser of [ healthy foods] would exercise.? 177 Thus, although HEARTWISE brand breakfast foods are a low- priced product, they need not reflexively be dumped in the ? low consumer- sophistication? basket, an extended experience with a purchase that may involve strong self- presentation aspects. All of these factors will tend to heighten the perceived risks of the purchase (adding performance and social risks to the financial risk already perceived), such that the consumer may be sufficiently motivated to find creative ways to overcome the time limitations of the home shopping environment— such as by waiting until the product is offered a second time or pursuing alternative channels, such as an internet website or toll- free number. 172 451 F. 2d 1190 (2d Cir. 1971). 173 Id. at 1195. 174 Id. 175 Id. 176 732 F. Supp. 1417 (S. D. Ohio 1990). 177 Id. at 1448. 608 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 since the physical risk associated with buying purportedly health- conscious foods may enhance the motivation for the exercise of consumer care, even if price alone does not increase consumer perceptions of financial risk. 178 There may also be circumstances where the financial risk persists even where the price of the product in question is low. Consider the case of Reed- Union Corp. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 179 in which the court found that a purchase of inexpensive car polish was nevertheless likely to involve relatively high levels of sophistication. 180 The court‘ s explanation— that this inexpensive product was to be used on an expensive possession (a car) 181— can easily be restated in terms of the motivation factor: Price is only part of the perceived financial risk associated with some purchases, and where use of the product could have a substantial impact on the value of another product, even low- priced purchases may present significant financial risk and thus a high level of situational involvement. Finally, there may be other low- priced products that would be naturally dominated by high ? need for cognition? consumers who would be intrinsically attracted to a product that gives them a chance to exert cognitive effort. Sudoku and other ? brain teaser? puzzle books, for example, present low financial risk, but the typical consumer of such products would likely possess a high need for cognition that would suggest higher levels of care regardless of low perceptions of financial risk. Thus, our model suggests some reason to doubt the conclusions of some courts that consumers of such products rate low on the consumer care scale. 182 178 The apparent perception of this sort of risk might be dampened, however, by the proliferation of purportedly healthy products available to consumers. If consumers are bombarded by health claims, they may tend to discount them, and thus not perceive any risk that would enhance their motivation for extended cognition. 179 869 F. Supp. 1304 (N. D. Ill. 1994), aff? d, 77 F. 3d 909 (7th Cir. 1996); see also Life Indus. Corp. v. Star Brite Distrib., Inc., 31 F. 3d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1994) (pointing to evidence showing that purchasers of inexpensive boat caulking are sophisticated because ? they usually are owners of large, expensive boats with wood decks?). 180 Reed- Union Corp., 869 F.

Length and Complexity of the Purchase Transaction A second factor frequently identified in the case law is the length and complexity of the purchase process. The more time the consumer is expected to devote to purchasing a particular product, the more care she is expected to take. There are two distinct strands of cases: (1) those where the courts have attempted to identify products that are by their very nature likely to be the subject of an ? impulse? purchase; and (2) those where the courts have examined the complexity of the purchasing process to determine whether a consumer is likely to engage in high levels of consumer care. Examples of products deemed inherently ? impulsive? include magazines (because consumers are thought to purchase them based on the cover or title), 183 snack foods (since consumers may purchase them without putting them on their grocery lists), 184 and fast food (which is purchased when consumers are in a hurry). 185 With respect to the purchasing process, the courts have sometimes correlated low levels of consumer care with quick or hurried transactions. For example, at least one court has suggested that direct- order television advertisements (? infomercials?) involve low- care, impulse purchases, since such ? advertising is directed toward those persons who tend to buy on impulse when they see a product on television which appeals to them at a reasonable price.? 186 Another court offered a similar assessment of the low level of care typically exercised in the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of a typical supermarket.? 187 of lectures on great philosophers by leading contemporary scholars, against defendant selling documentary films under the GREAT MINDS mark). 183 See Brockmeyer v. Hearst Corp., 248 F. Supp. 2d 281, 299 (S. D. N. Y. 2003) (generalizing that magazines are impulse purchases); see also Playboy Enter., Inc. v. Chuckleberry Publ‘ g, Inc., 687 F. 2d 563, 570 (2d Cir. 1982) (finding that magazine subtitles contribute greatly to impulse buying). 184 See Gray v. Meijer, Inc., 295 F. 3d 641, 649– 50 (6th Cir. 2002) (determining that buyers of inexpensive snack foods do not exercise a high degree of care); Beer Nuts, Inc., v. Clover Club Foods Co., 805 F. 2d 920, 926– 27 (10th Cir. 1986) (finding that there is a high likelihood of confusion in purchasing a snack- nut mix because consumers exercise little care when purchasing competing brands ? Beer Nuts? and ? Brew Nuts?— those items are impulse purchases that are not generally on the consumer‘ s grocery list). 185 See Frisch‘ s Rests. v. Elby‘ s Big Boy, 670 F. 2d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 1982) (finding a casual degree of care in ? impulse buying? of fast food items); Burger Chef Sys., Inc. v. Burger Man, Inc., 492 F. 2d 1398, 1399 (C. C. P. A. 1974) (describing fast- food customers as on the move and in a hurry). 186 Telebrands Corp. v. E. Mishan & Sons, 46 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1493, 1508 (S. D. N. Y. 1997). 187 Lever Bros. v. Am. Bakeries Co., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 248, 255 (E. D. N. Y. 1982) (concluding that ? the ordinary purchaser of AUTUMN margarine and AUTUMN GRAIN bread is a casual, unsophisticated buyer,? and an atmosphere ? in which over 5,000 trademarked items are presented? is unlikely to be conducive to a high level of consumer care). 610 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 Conversely, the courts have also identified circumstances where the purchasing environment is conducive to (or even requires) the exercise of high levels of consumer care. In Star Industries v. Bacardi & Co., 188 for example, the court concluded that liquor store purchases are not likely to constrain levels of consumer care— in light of the store‘ s generally relaxed environment as compared to a supermarket. 189 Alternatively, the courts have found sophistication in circumstances involving extended negotiation and interaction with sales personnel. Examples of purchases deemed to involve this sort of sophistication run the gamut from lawn and garden equipment to perfume. 190 The assumption is that trained personnel can be expected to ? help[] inform customers of the differences in the products.? 191 Elsewhere, the courts have concluded that inherently complex transactions can be expected to involve high levels of care. Under this analysis, the courts have held that consumers of certain financial instruments are ? sophisticated? because of the steps required to complete a transaction through a financial institution. 192 On similar analysis, the courts have anticipated high levels of care in the purchase of a health care plan. 193 188 412 F. 3d 373 (2d Cir. 2005). 189 Id. at 390 (differentiating the ? rough and tumble? atmosphere at grocery stores from the ? relaxed environment of the liquor store,? where unhurried customers will ? exhibit sufficient sophistication? to distinguish between different stylized scripts on the competing brands‘ labels, thus decreasing likelihood of confusion). Alcoholic beverages are one product category where the courts have sent conflicting signals as to the expected level of consumer care. The conflict in the case law is discussed in some detail infra notes 252– 57. 190 See, e. g., Deere & Co. v. MTD Holdings, Inc., 70 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1009, 1023 (S. D. N. Y. 2004) (finding that consumer interaction with sales personnel when purchasing expensive lawn and garden maintenance equipment would help to dispel confusion, such that purchasers of such equipment are deemed to exercise a higher degree of care); Conopco, Inc. v. Cosmair, Inc., 49 F. Supp. 2d 242, 257 (S. D. N. Y. 1999) (?

Y. 2005) (stating that the key determination is the number of steps required, as well as the value of the financial instruments involved and noting that where consumers merely open a bank account or purchase certificates of deposit, the sophistication level does not necessarily increase). 193 Am.

May 21, 1996) (stating that because of the time and effort consumers spend evaluating different health care plans, consumer naivety as to the different plans available decreases, so consumers are deemed more sophisticated). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 611 The consumer behavior model provides a useful framework for evaluating these cases. The impulse- product cases are most naturally evaluated under the motivation construct, which suggests that ? impulse? purchases will be those that present little perceived risk. The purchase- process cases implicate the ability construct and the question of whether and to what extent the purchasing environment requires, permits, or limits opportunities for the exercise of care during the source- identification judgment. As a general matter, we find that judicial intuitions in these cases find support in the theoretical foundations of the model. We also conclude, however, that the model provides a basis for questioning the results in some of the cases and— more broadly— some cautionary limits on further development of the jurisprudence. As with price, we find that judicial intuitions with respect to the time and complexity of the purchase process veer off course where the courts focus myopically on any single factor in the consumer care function. A reliable assessment of the degree of consumer care requires a complete consideration of all of the elements of the consumer behavior model, and the analysis is distorted (as in some of the cases highlighted below) where the courts focus on isolated elements of the model to the exclusion of others. 1. “ Impulse Products,” Motivation, and Risk According to the consumer behavior model, products likely to be purchased on ? impulse? are those that present relatively little motivation for the exercise of consumer care. There is some overlap with the price factor discussed above: impulse items will tend to be low in price and thus present little financial risk. But the involvement construct allows us to generalize the ? impulse? category beyond price: ? impulse? purchases should be defined to encompass products that present minimal motivation for involvement across any of the various risk factors (financial, performance, physical, and social). Thus, under the model, impulse items would encompass lower- cost items that are consumed within a short horizon, that the consumer is relatively familiar with, and for which perceived social and physical risk are relatively low. 194 Much of the ? impulse product? case law finds support in this analysis. Magazines, snack foods, and fast food meet the foregoing criteria; thus, they are likely to present minimal risk (whether financial, performance, physical, or 194 See RICHARD P. BAGOZZI, PRINCIPLES OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT 61– 63 (1986). 612 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 social) and consequently present little motivation for the exercise of consumer care. The model also provides a limiting principle, however, and thus a basis for confining the ? impulse product? categories to their proper bounds. Although impulse products ordinarily implicate a low level of motivation for consumer care, that will not always be so. 195 Consider health food items. Should such purchases be deemed to involve low levels of consumer care, at least where they may fall under the ? snack food? or ? fast food? categories? Perhaps not. The question is whether these items present some element of risk as a motivation for the exercise of consumer care— not whether they can fit into some abstract category of ? fast food? or ? snack food.? At least one court has suggested that consumers may be expected to ? purchase = healthy‘ products quickly, but not impulsively or carelessly.? 196 That conclusion is at least arguably consistent with a careful parsing of the involvement construct: such products may not present any significant financial risk or time commitment in the purchase transaction, but they may implicate an element of physical risk that may enhance the motivation for the exercise of consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 197 In the health- food niche, consumers may be assumed to be more concerned about physical risk, and thus to expend greater cognitive resources than they would if they were focused only on the (minimal) financial risk associated with a snack food purchase. Thus, the ? impulse product? question should be evaluated based on the degree of relative risk factors as motivations for extended involvement, not on blind adherence to precedents identifying broad product categories deemed forever likely to be purchased on impulse. Some items, such as condoms, would by their nature and use create high involvement and time investment with their purchase because they produce, for 195 Recall the Sudoku example above, supra text accompanying note 182, of low- priced products aimed at a customer base that is high in ? need for cognition.? The point is that perceived financial risk is only one trigger for motivation for consumer care. Where other triggers are present, a product that may ordinarily be thought of as an impulse purchase may nevertheless involve a high degree of consumer care. 196 See Luigino‘ s, Inc. v. Stouffer Corp., 170 F. 3d 827, 831 (8th Cir. 1999). 197 See Stouffer Corp. v. Health Valley Natural Foods, Inc., 1 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1900, 1902 (T. T. A. B. 1987) (?[ D] iet- conscious purchasers of these prepared entrees are a special class of purchasers who may be expected, at least, to examine the front of the packages in order to determine what kind of entree is contained therein and its caloric content.?), aff? d, 831 F. 2d 306 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Alternatively, with respect to some ? niche? or specialty foods, consumers may exhibit a sort of avocational devotion or ? enduring involvement? in the product category at issue. The enduring involvement concept is discussed in greater detail infra notes 198– 207. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 613 many consumers, heightened perceptions of risk (physical, social, etc.) leading to the exercise of high levels of consumer care. A similar example identified in the case law is shoes. At least one court has suggested that even though shoes may be relatively low- priced, they may not properly be classifiable as an impulse item. 198 The court‘ s conclusions can be understood in terms of the motivation construct: shoes may present physical and social risk as motivations for involvement even if they do not entail any significant financial risk. 199 2. Purchase Processes and Effects on Opportunity for the Exertion of Consumer Care In the purchase- process cases, the courts have identified purchasing environments that facilitate, foreclose, or even require opportunities for the exercise of consumer care. These cases implicate the ability element of the consumer behavior model, which explains that consumer care may be affected not only by motivation, but also by the degree of opportunity to engage in extended cognition. This construct provides an analytical foundation for understanding these cases. But it also provides a limiting principle to guide the development of the case law and for questioning some of the outcomes in the cases. a. Unconstrained Opportunity In Star Industries, Inc. v. Bacardi & Co., 200 the court concluded that the relaxed atmosphere of a liquor store would facilitate consumer care and that consumers in that environment would not likely be confused by defendant Bacardi‘ s use of an elliptical, stylized ? O? trademark on its orange- flavored rum— a mark that purportedly was confusingly similar to plaintiff Star Industries‘ elliptical, stylized ? O? mark on its orange- flavored vodka. 201 This analysis finds an initial foothold in the opportunity element of the ability construct: Consumers who feel at ease in a purchasing environment will not have any limitations placed on their ability to exercise a high degree of 198 See Reebok Int‘ l Ltd. v. K- Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 252, 268 (S. D. N. Y. 1994). 199 Id. at 268 (noting that ? shoes are an item worn daily? that ? can lead a customer to experience ongoing discomfort and physical pain,? and are thus ? much less likely to be the subject of impulse purchases than other low priced consumer goods or consumables?). 200 412 F. 3d 373 (2d Cir. 2005). 201 Id. at 390. 614 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 consumer care. This uninhibited opportunity stands in contrast to the ? bustling . . . atmosphere of a typical supermarket.? 202 The Star Industries court‘ s analysis is flawed (or at least incomplete), however, in ways that are illuminated by a broader understanding of the consumer behavior model. Ability is a necessary— but not sufficient— condition for the exercise of consumer care, in that a consumer who has all of the opportunity in the world will not be careful unless she has sufficient motivation to do so. For that reason, without a consideration of the motivation of typical consumers, it cannot reliably be said that [ u] nhurried consumers in the relaxed environment of the liquor store may be expected to educate themselves sufficiently to recognize the respective brand names, to understand the respective stature of the two companies, and thus to understand how fanciful the notion is that Bacardi would seek the benefit of Star‘ s reputation and good will by entering into a licensing agreement to secure utilization of its ? O? design. 203 The ? unhurried? environment gives liquor purchasers an opportunity ? to educate themselves sufficiently? and to be careful enough ? to understand? the lack of any association between Bacardi and Star, but that unconstrained ability alone is insufficient. The key question is whether they will have the motivation to do so. They will if they perceive sufficient risk (such as financial or perhaps social risk associated with the liquor purchase), but otherwise, no amount of uninhibited, ? unhurried? opportunity will yield this degree of the exercise of consumer care. The elaborate investment in education and care imagined by the Star Industries court is substantial; it seems doubtful that anyone, other than the most motivated (and ? unhurried?) consumer, would exercise the degree of care hypothesized by the court. 204 But, at a minimum, the model indicates that opportunity alone is an insufficient basis for a finding of high levels of consumer care or sophistication. The courts‘ assumptions about interactions with sales personnel are similarly flawed. It may well be that a consumer who is sufficiently motivated in the purchase of lawn and garden equipment or perfume will exercise even 202 Lever Bros. v. Am. Bakeries Co., 537 F. Supp. 248, 255 (E. D. N. Y. 1982) (concluding that ? the ordinary purchaser of AUTUMN margarine and AUTUMN GRAIN bread is a casual, unsophisticated buyer,? and also explaining that an atmosphere ? in which over 5,000 trademarked items are presented? is unlikely to be conducive to a high level of consumer care). 203 Star Industries, 412 F. 3d at 390. 204 Id. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 615 more care where the ? opportunity? for such cognition is facilitated by trained personnel who can be expected to ? help[] inform customers of the differences in the products.? 205 But it cannot reliably be said that such opportunity alone ensures high levels of care. The threshold question is whether there is sufficient motivation for consumers to exercise care. For lawn and garden equipment that presents little or no risk (e. g., an inexpensive pair of work gloves), no amount of opportunity will ensure a high degree of consumer care. b. Compelled “ Opportunity” (and Increased Capacity) On the other hand, the courts are on stronger theoretical footing in cases where the purchase process requires extended interaction with sales personnel in an inherently complex purchase. In cases involving complex financial instruments or healthcare plans, for example, the consumer behavior model arguably provides some support for the judicial inference of a high degree of consumer care. The reason is that, in those circumstances, the consumer can be presumed to have sufficient motivation (if she proceeds through a complex or multi- step process requiring the exertion of cognition), and the extended opportunity for involvement can only add to the degree of care exercised by the consumer. In other words, where the transaction can proceed only if the consumer proceeds through a complex, multi- step purchase process, we can assume that all consumers who endure this process have sufficient motivation. Since they are sufficiently motivated, the extended opportunity— of frequent exposure over a long period of time— increases the likelihood of exercising a high degree of consumer care. 206 A complex, multi- step purchase process may also enhance a consumer‘ s ? capability? to exercise consumer care. Consumers who have had repeated opportunities to encounter relevant market information will develop more active knowledge structures that will facilitate more efficient and more effective judgment. 207 Thus, the multi- step purchase process indicates a high 205 Frances Rothschild v. U. S. Cosmetic Fragrance Mktg. Corp., 223 U. S. P. Q. 817, 818 (N. D. Tex. 1983). 206 We are a little less sanguine about the blithe judicial assertion that sales personnel can always be expected to ? help[] inform customers? in their performance of the source- identification judgment. Id. Some sales personnel may facilitate source- identification in some circumstances, but that will not always be the case. In some circumstances, the salesperson‘ s motivation will be very different from the consumer‘ s; the former may sometimes give in to the perverse incentive to thwart source identification if that is what it takes to convince the consumer to make the purchase. 207 See supra text accompanying notes 136– 37. 616 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 level of consumer care across several levels of the model: motivation is assumed, while opportunity is required. 208 A similar approach may be the key to understanding a conflict in the case law over the question of whether the ? wine buying public? is ? a highly discriminating group? 209 or a collection of ? generally unsophisticated = impulse‘ buyers who are an = easy mark for a [ trademark] infringer.‘? 210 In criticizing the former conclusion (adopted in 1959 by a federal district court in Alabama), the latter court relied on expert testimony to conclude that ? the average American consumer is unlearned in the selection of wine.? 211 The difference in the courts‘ assessments of the degree of consumer sophistication, however, seems to have more to do with differences in opportunity than with any difference in available evidence of capability. In the Alabama case, there was evidence before the court that state law effectively compelled an extended opportunity to exercise consumer care. 212 Specifically, as the court explained: The evidence reflects that practically all of the wine in the State of Alabama is sold through state owned and operated liquor stores. The law requires that the prospective purchaser select from display counters the product he desires, and after making that selection he is required to request that product of the salesman by name. After paying the cashier for the product, it is produced by the salesman for the purchaser‘ s inspection prior to the time it is packaged. Thus, in the State of Alabama it is virtually impossible for a wine purchaser to be confused by similar trademarks. 213 This is compelled ? opportunity.? The Alabama wine buyer was effectively required to exercise consumer care through a multi- step exchange with a salesman that involved a request and confirmation of the product name. Such a consumer can be presumed to possess at least enough motivation to complete these steps in order to make the purchase. Thus, and for this reason, the Alabama wine- buying public in 1959 was to some degree a ? discriminating 208 We hasten to add two important caveats. First, as explained above, in some circumstances, the steps in a complex purchase process may actually interfere with the source- identification judgment. If sales personnel are motivated to complete the sale, irrespective of any concern about consumer confusion, they may— consciously or unconsciously— shed more noise than light on the source- identification judgment. Second, and as elaborated below, compelled care will never be the same as care spurred on by a consumer‘ s native involvement. See infra text accompanying note 212. 209 E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Ben R. Goltsman & Co., 172 F. Supp. 826, 830 n. 2 (M. D. Ala. 1959). 210 E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Consorzio del Gallo Nero, 782 F. Supp. 457, 465 (N. D. Cal. 1991). 211 Id. 212 See Ben R. Goltsman & Co., 172 F. Supp. at 830 n. 3. 213 Id. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 617 group,? even if the discrimination was not the result of any situational or enduring involvement. Our model gives ample reason to doubt the court‘ s bolder assertion, however, that it would be ? virtually impossible? for such a wine purchaser to be confused. 214 We see no reason to expect that consumers compelled to engage in an extended purchase process would exercise the degree of care necessary to distinguish between two facially identical trademarks. Indeed, compelled care is an imperfect substitute for care triggered by perceived risk or enduring involvement. A consumer who is compelled to go through the motions of a purchase process will be more likely to just ? go through the motions.? Thus, although a consumer compelled to participate in extended opportunities for care may be somewhat more careful than one who is not, the compelled consumer is not the equivalent of the consumer whose care is spurred by her own perceptions of risk or her native enduring involvement. c. Reduced Opportunity Finally, if opportunity is conceived of as a necessary prerequisite to consumer care, the consumer behavior model also provides theoretical support for a finding of relatively low levels of consumer care in purchasing environments that reduce opportunities for care. The ? infomercial? case cited above arguably fits in here. 215 To the extent an infomercial requires a hurried, impulsive purchase, a low level of consumer care is indicated despite whatever risk factors might otherwise cue motivation for extended involvement. Similarly, if the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of the typical supermarket? makes it impossible for consumers to engage in careful transactions, 216 then consumer care is untenable. Our model suggests good reasons to be skeptical of such a finding, however. Even in the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of the typical supermarket,? we might expect a consumer faced with sufficient financial risk— such as in the purchase of a relatively expensive product— to be sufficiently motivated that she might overcome the cacophony of the purchase situation and exercise a relatively high degree of care. Where motivation is 214 Id. 215 See supra note 186 and accompanying text (discussing Telebrands Corp. v. E. Mishan & Sons, 46 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1493, 1508 (S. D. N. Y. 1997)). 216 Lever Bros. v. Am.

Thus, a refinement of the ? necessary condition? formulation may be in order: An adequate opportunity is a necessary condition for the exercise of consumer care, but the adequacy of the opportunity will necessarily vary in relation to the level of consumer motivation.

The informed, rigorous view of the consumer that emerges is much more nuanced and complex than that of either fool or sovereign. We offer a positive framework for understanding the basic strands of the judicial conceptions of consumer sophistication and interject normative criticism in cases where we find fault with the jurisprudence. Lastly, we employ the model to take a broader look at the relevance ( and relative significance) of consumer sophistication in trademark infringement cases. Our methodology offers insights that can inform— and transform— a broad range of issues in a body of law that can no longer afford to ignore the field of consumer psychology. By moving beyond stereotypes and rhetorical flourishes about the validity vel non of the portrayal of the consumer as the ? presumptive idiot,? our model opens analytical doors that account for the realities of consumer behavior and helps to resolve many of the conflicts and inconsistencies in trademark law. I. THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION AND THE REASONABLY PRUDENT CONSUMER The legal touchstone of trademark infringement is a showing of a likelihood of consumer confusion. 16 In evaluating the likelihood of confusion, the standard focuses on the ? ordinary? or ? reasonably prudent? consumer. 17 As noted above, the courts have expressed a range of different views as to the mindset of this ? ordinary? or ? reasonably prudent? consumer. 18 To some degree, the cases leave room for the impression that courts may simply be ? adjusting their finding of whether the relevant consumer population is 16 See 15 U. S. C. § 1114( 1) ( 2006) ( establishing that a federally registered mark is infringed where the defendant‘ s use is ? likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive?). 17 See Savin Corp. v. Savin Group, 391 F. 3d 439, 461 ( 2d Cir. 2004) (?[ T] he pertinent question is whether = numerous ordinary prudent purchasers‘ would likely = be misled or confused as to the source of the product in question because of the entrance in the marketplace of [ Defendants‘] mark.‘?); Dreamwerks Prod. Group, Inc. v. SKG Studio, 142 F. 3d 1127, 1129 ( 9th Cir. 1998) (? The test for likelihood of confusion is whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.?); see also MCCARTHY, supra note 2, § 23: 93 ( asserting and citing extensive cases for the proposition that ? everything hinges upon whether there is a likelihood of confusion in the mind of an appreciable number of = reasonably prudent‘ buyers?). 18 See sources cited supra note 17. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 579 sophisticated or unsophisticated to conform to the result they wish to achieve.? 19 Despite this cynical characterization, the courts have long evaluated the likelihood of confusion under a series of circumstantial factors. The seminal federal case under the Lanham Act is Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 20 which identified the following eight factors relevant to the likelihood of confusion: [ T] he strength of [ the plaintiff‘ s] mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the [ competitive] proximity of the products [ or services], the likelihood that [ the plaintiff] will bridge the gap [ between two markets], [ the existence of] actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant‘ s good faith in adopting its own mark, the quality of [ the] defendant‘ s product, and the sophistication of the buyers. 21 Since then, federal courts have offered some variations on these themes, but courts continue to focus primarily on the areas identified by the Second Circuit. 22 The eighth factor, referred to alternatively as the ? consumer‘ s degree of care,? 23 or ? consumer sophistication,? 24 encompasses several considerations that are thought by the courts to affect the attention consumers may pay to their purchases. Under this factor, the courts generally hold that if a consumer can be expected to exercise a high degree of care, she will be less likely to be confused by any connection between a senior and junior trademark. 25 A 19 Beebe, supra note 8, at 2040; see also id. at n. 85 (?[ A] cynic would say that . . . when the court wants to find no infringement, it says that the average buyer is cautious and careful . . . [ b] ut if the judge thinks there is infringement, the judge sets the standard lower and says the average buyer is gullible and not so discerning.?)

A key threshold question in the case law is how to distinguish the careful and sophisticated consumer from the unthinking and credulous one.

See RUDOLF CALLMANN, CALLMANN ON UNFAIR COMPETITION, TRADEMARKS AND MONOPOLIES § 21: 10 ( Louis Altman ed., 2003) ( stating that the degree of consumer care ? will differ according to the = character of the article, the use to which it is put, the kind of people who ask for it, and the manner in which it is ordered‘?); JEROME GILSON & ANNE GILSON LALONDE, TRADEMARK PROTECTION AND PRACTICE § 5.08 ( 2004) ( asserting that ? the courts . . . classify purchasers into two types, ordinary purchasers and discriminating or sophisticated purchasers,? with the former having ? no special training or experience,? and the latter having either ? special training? or ? purchas[ ing] costly products?); MCCARTHY, supra note 2, at § § 23: 95– 23: 102 ( identifying price, class of purchasers, and other factors relevant to the degree of consumer sophistication). 31 See infra text accompanying notes 139– 81. 32 See infra text accompanying notes 183– 216. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 581 education, age, gender, and income; 34 and the notion that professional buyers, 35 avid hobbyists, 36 and ( sometimes) women37 are more sophisticated. As explained in further detail below, the case law elaborating these considerations is based on an ad hoc, impressionistic conception of sophistication; the courts have never articulated anything approaching a rigorous, theoretical understanding of consumer care. Yet the perceived degree of sophistication can often be the factor that dictates the degree of protection afforded by law to a trademark holder. Some courts have gone so far as to suggest that a high degree of consumer sophistication in a target market may trump all other factors, virtually eliminating the likelihood of consumer confusion in the case of a professional or highly sophisticated buyer. 38 Other courts are much more measured in their assessment of the relative significance of this factor, suggesting that its ? import? is ? small indeed? ( at least in cases where the junior and senior trademarks are ? identical?). 39 In assessing the significance of consumer care or sophistication, at least one court has suggested a distinction between source confusion and confusion as to 33 See infra text accompanying notes 217– 20. 34 See infra text accompanying notes 258– 318. 35 See infra text accompanying notes 222– 56. 36 See id. 37 See infra text accompanying notes 319– 30. 38 Sara Lee Corp. v.

Y. 1977) ( stating that ?[ t] he Second Circuit has noted that the importance of this criterion is minimal where the marks in question are identical?). As to the empirical question of whether ( and to what extent) the sophistication factor actually does affect the outcomes of the cases, Professor Beebe has concluded that this is the only ? non- core? factor that correlates significantly with judicial outcomes. Beebe, supra note 13, at 1612, 1642– 43 ( identifying as ? non- core? factors ? purchaser sophistication, similarity of advertising/ marketing, similarity of sales facilities, and likelihood of bridging the gap?). Specifically, Beebe concludes that a ? finding that the consumer sophistication factor disfavors a likelihood of confusion correlates fairly strongly with an overall finding of no likelihood of confusion,? id. at 1612, but that ? the Second Circuit is significantly less likely than other circuits to find that the consumer sophistication factor disfavors a likelihood of confusion,? id. at 1643. Beebe‘ s study confirms the practical significance of this factor, while also indicating that its significance may vary by circuit. His data, however, say little about whether the sophistication factor should count in the likelihood of confusion inquiry, or, importantly, how its significance may vary depending on the relative strength of the parties‘ proof on other factors. Our analysis does not offer any empirical answer to this important question, but we do offer some theoretical analysis infra Part IV. B. 582 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 sponsorship.

A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODEL OF ? SOPHISTICATION?: MOTIVATION AND ABILITY AS FACTORS INFLUENCING COGNITIVE EFFORT The legal touchstone of trademark infringement boils down to a fundamental matter of consumer psychology. 47 As such, this legal standard should be shaped by a careful, informed analysis of consumer behavior, not by stereotypes and generalizations about the informed ? sovereign? or complete ? fool.? Thus, a careful investigation of the literature in this field is warranted. Firms often attempt to differentiate their products from the similar offerings of competitors. 48 For example, a firm selling gasoline to consumers may add proprietary detergents and performance enhancements to the gasoline in an attempt to differentiate it from other gasolines. Typically, a firm attempting to differentiate its product will ? brand? the product with a trademark. When a consumer is faced with a variety of differentiated products in a marketplace, the consumer will try to discern which products would suit her needs better than others. If the consumer finds a familiar brand in the marketplace, the consumer can identify the source of the product and infer the product‘ s attributes and quality much more quickly than if the consumer laboriously investigates the product to determine its attributes and quality. 49 For example, a motorist seeking gasoline need not do an in- depth analysis of the quality of a gasoline if it is sold under a brand name the consumer knows and respects. Before the consumer can use the brand as a shortcut for judging the attributes and quality of a product encountered in the marketplace, she must first identify the product‘ s brand. That is to say, the consumer must ascertain the identity of the source of the product ( a judgment we refer to hereafter as the 46 SecuraComm Consulting, Inc., 984 F. Supp. at 299 ( finding a likelihood of confusion in the junior‘ s use of the SECURACOM mark in competition with plaintiff‘ s SECURACOMM mark). 47 See Mishawaka v. S. S. Kresge, 316 U. S. 203, 205 ( 1942) (? The protection of trade- marks is the law‘ s recognition of the psychological function of symbols.?); RICHARD L. KIRKPATRICK, LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION IN TRADEMARK LAW, at xx ( 2005) ( asserting that ? the question of trademark infringement is primarily one of the psychology— cognitive and behavioral— of consumers?). 48 See Byron Sharp & John Dawes, What Is Differentiation and How Does It Work?, 17 J. MARKETING MGMT. 739, 739 ( 2001) (? Differentiation is an old concept and one that is very basic to modern views of markets and marketing . . . .?). 49 Jacoby, supra note 14, at 1025. 584 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 ? source- identification judgment?). 50 The role of brands as shortcuts for evaluating quality when products are differentiated suggests that consumers will not always perform source- identification judgments. If the consumer believes competing products are undifferentiated, the brand‘ s identity does not add useful information to the consumer‘ s decision, so she is unlikely to perform the source- identification judgment. For example, a consumer who believes that ? all ketchup is the same? is unlikely to bother making a source- identification judgment when purchasing ketchup. Furthermore, if the consumer believes that product quality can be fully and easily judged, a shortcut for product evaluation is not useful to the consumer, so she is unlikely to perform the source- identification judgment. For example, a consumer purchasing meat may consider USDA grading to be a sufficient indicator that the meat is safe to consume and accurately labeled, making brand irrelevant. Arguably, brand name is relevant for the vast majority of consumer purchases. Even products that were once seen as undifferentiated ( e. g., gasoline, ketchup, coffee, pickles, bath soap, and water) have been differentiated and branded. 51 Furthermore, in the absence of a certification mark ( e. g., USDA grading for meats, Underwriters Laboratories for portable electronic tools, U. S. Coast Guard for life jackets), consumers often find it difficult to fully evaluate product quality without thorough physical inspection, purchase, and consumption. Because brands are so often relevant to consumer purchases, consumers typically perform a source- identification judgment when they consider products. 52 50 Under a longstanding rule of trademark law, the consumer‘ s ? identification? of the source need not extend to an awareness of the actual name of the manufacturer or distributor of the products in question. See 15 U. S. C. § 1127 ( 2006) ( defining a ? trademark? as ? any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof—( 1) used by a person; or ( 2) which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register established by this chapter, to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown?) ( emphasis added). Thus, when we speak of the source- identification judgment, we refer to the trademark law concept of the consumer concluding that products bearing the same trademark come from a common— even if anonymous— source. See MCCARTHY, supra note 2, § 3: 7 (? However, the = identification‘ function of marks does not mean that the consumer must know the identity of the manufacturer or distributor of the goods. Seeing the same mark on goods merely identifies to the buyer the fact that all such goods come from a common, even though anonymous, source.?). 51 KEVIN LANE KELLER, STRATEGIC BRAND MANAGEMENT: BUILDING, MEASURING, AND MANAGING BRAND EQUITY 11 ( Prentice Hall 2003) ( 1998). 52 As Jack Jacoby has explained, ? brand names serve as information = chunks,‘? in that they ? represent core nodes in memory around which other = associated‘ information is connected and organized.? Jacoby, supra note 14, at 1024. Thus, ?[ g] iven only a familiar brand name, a host of relevant and important information can be efficiently called into consciousness.? Id. at 1024– 25. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 585 This is not to suggest that consumers always perform the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly. 53 According to the theories developed in the consumer behavior literature, a consumer attempting to avoid source confusion by making a source- identification judgment must perform a series of steps. First, the consumer must gather product information that she considers of potential relevance to the source- identification judgment. 54 Such information might include the trademark itself, trade dress, and the price at which the product is being offered. Second, the consumer must comprehend the information— that is, consider the information to determine its meaning. 55 Whereas some types of information ( such as brief and simple written descriptions) are easily comprehended by most consumers, others ( such as numeric56 and technical57 data) are more difficult for most consumers to comprehend. Third, the consumer must identify the implications of the environmental information and integrate the implications to form the source- identification judgment. 58 To perform the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly, the consumer will form an initial hypothesis ( i. e., an initial judgment) concerning the source of the product and then will consider further information in an attempt to validate the initial hypothesis. If the initial hypothesis is not supported by the new information, the process is repeated until the consumer forms a source- identification in which she is sufficiently confident. Each of the three steps of the source- identification judgment is a mental or cognitive process. That is, each step takes place in the mind of the consumer. One of the main tenets of the consumer psychology literature is that such 53 Nor do we mean to imply that source- identification will be relevant to every consumer. As explained infra Part IV, not every consumer who is equally motivated to engage in effortful cognition can be expected to direct her cognitive resources at the source- identification judgment. Thus, although we adopt the simplifying assumption here that brand names will be relevant to most consumer purchases, we relax that assumption in our broader critique of the law infra Part IV. 54 See Keller, supra note 51, at 9 ( proposing brand identification within consumption choice situations constitutes a source- identity judgment); see also Joel B. Cohen & Kunal Basu, Alternative Models of Categorization: Toward a Contingent Processing Framework, 13 J. CONSUMER RES. 455, 455 ( 1987) ( proposing that brand identification is a categorization judgment, which requires information search about the product at hand). 55 See JAMES R. BETTMAN, AN INFORMATION PROCESSING THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 29 ( 1979). 56 Richard F. Yalch & Rebecca Elmore- Yalch, The Effect of Numbers on the Route to Persuasion, 11 J.

MARKETING 57, 59– 61 ( 1980). 58 Cohen & Basu, supra note 54, at 456. 586 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 mental processes require cognitive effort. 59 Just as physical activity ( e. g., climbing stairs) requires physical effort, so mental activity ( e. g., searching the environment for information) requires cognitive effort. Therefore, a consumer can make the source- identification judgment in a thorough and vigilant manner only by expending ample cognitive effort. If she fails to devote sufficient cognitive effort to the source- identification task, it can be expected that she will gather inadequate environmental information, will not attempt to comprehend information that is difficult to comprehend, and will perform the source- identification judgment in a haphazard and offhand way. Presumably, if a consumer performs the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly, she is unlikely to suffer source confusion. 60 However, if she performs the judgment in a haphazard and thoughtless manner, she may not consider the differences between the junior and senior trademarks. As a result, she will be vulnerable to source confusion. 61 Therefore, one determinant of an individual consumer‘ s likelihood of confusion is the extent to which she expends cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment. Fortunately, consumer psychology researchers have given a great deal of research attention to identifying the antecedents of an individual consumer‘ s exertion of cognitive effort. The first broad category of antecedents relates to the individual‘ s motivation to expend cognitive effort. Just as people are typically reluctant to exert physical effort ( e. g., people using escalators instead of climbing stairs) but will do so if they are sufficiently motivated, so people will exert cognitive effort only if they are sufficiently motivated. In effect, consumers act as cognitive misers62 who exert cognitive effort only when they 59 Yalch & Elmore- Yalch, supra note 56, at 526; see also Ellen C. Garbarino & Julie A. Edell, Cognitive Effort, Affect, and Choice, 24 J. CONSUMER RES. 147, 147– 48 ( 1997) ( discussing two different studies examining the relationship between consumer psychology and cognitive effort). 60 This is not to suggest that a consumer who performs the source- identification judgment thoroughly and vigilantly cannot be confused. If the junior and senior trademarks are identical, not even a thorough and vigilant inspection by the consumer will prevent source confusion. Furthermore, recent research findings suggest that if two trademarks have the same semantic meaning, consumers who exert a high degree of care may be more confused than consumers who exert a low degree of care. See Daniel J. Howard et al., The Effects of Brand Name Similarity on Brand Source Confusion: Implications for Trademark Infringement, 19 J. PUB. POL‘ Y & MARKETING 250, 261 ( 2000). 61 Jean- Noel Kapferer, Brand Confusion: Empirical Study of a Legal Concept, 12 PSYCHOL. & MARKETING 551, 554 ( 1995). 62 See Michael J. Houston et al., Picture- Word Consistency and the Elaborative Processing of Advertisements, 24 J. MARKETING RES. 359, 360 ( 1987) ( showing the role of elaborative processing during advertising exposure); see also Alice H. Eagly & Shelly Chaiken, Attitude Structure and Function, in 1 THE 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 587 have sufficient incentive to do so. 63 The second broad category of antecedents is the individual‘ s ability to exert cognitive effort. 64 Just as people may be inhibited in their ability to perform a physical task ( e. g., the stairs are particularly steep or the climber has an arthritic knee), so customers can be restricted in their ability to exert cognitive effort as they perform the judgment at hand. Motivation and ability are each necessary but insufficient conditions for an individual to exert cognitive effort. That is, if either motivation or ability is lacking, the individual will exert little cognitive effort while performing a judgment task. Thus, consumer behavior literature suggests that if a consumer is to perform the source- identification judgment in a meticulous and vigilant manner, she must be sufficiently motivated and able to exert the cognitive effort necessary to perform such a judgment. 65 In contrast, if an individual lacks either motivation or ability to expend cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, she will perform the task in a haphazard and offhand manner, resulting in an increased likelihood of confusion. Viewed through this theoretical lens, the legal concept of the ? degree of consumer care? considered by the courts is similar to the notion described in the consumer behavior literature as the level of exerted cognitive effort. The courts have generally held that if consumers exercise a low degree of care, likelihood of confusion in the marketplace will be increased. 66 Consumer psychology theory supports the same prediction: If an individual consumer HANDBOOK OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 269, 292 ( Daniel Todd Gilbert et al. eds., 4th ed. 1993) ( describing the role of selective attention and perception processes in allocation of limited cognitive resources to salient environmental stimuli); James M. Olson & Mark P. Zanna, Attitudes and Attitude Change, 44 ANN. REV. PSYCHOL. 117, 135– 36 ( 1993) ( discussing research confirming that consumers engage in the minimum amount of deliberation necessary to provide themselves with sufficient judgmental confidence when making consumption choices). 63 A pejorative reading ( i. e., consumers are cognitively lazy and therefore corrupt and deficient) is unnecessary. By expending physical effort only when motivated to do so, humans conserve energy and thereby hold in reserve the energy to act when necessary. An individual who continually expends maximum physical effort at every possible opportunity would expend mostly unnecessary effort and would probably be unable to survive. The same can be said for cognitive effort; if the many judgments an individual makes during a typical day were made with maximum vigilance and thoroughness, the individual would be unable to function effectively. 64 See Noel Capon & Roger Davis, Basic Cognitive Ability Measures as Predictors of Consumer Information Processing Strategies, 11 J. CONSUMER RES. 551, 552 ( 1984). 65 See supra note 62. 66 See supra notes 25– 30. 588 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 exerts little cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, the individual is more likely to experience source confusion. 67 This analysis can be employed to refine the terminology employed in the case law. ? Sophistication? and ? consumer care? are used almost interchangeably by the courts, 68 but the terms are not precisely synonymous. Instead, sophistication is an antecedent of consumer care. Consumers can be said to be ? sophisticated? when they have both the motivation and ability to exercise a high degree of consumer care when performing the source- identification judgment. Thus a ? sophisticated? consumer emerges from the confluence of motivation and ability. In the sub- sections below, we explain the considerations identified in the consumer behavior literature as relevant to consumer motivation and ability to process information carefully. For clarity of exposition here, the elements of the model are illustrated in Figure 1 below ( with outline headings that correspond to the sub- sections that expand on these elements below). 67 See Howard et al., supra note 60, at 261. 68 See, e. g., Kellogg Co. v. Toucan Golf, Inc., 337 F. 3d 616, 623 ( 6th Cir. 2003) ( characterizing this factor as ? the probable degree of purchaser care and sophistication?); Bristol- Myers Squibb Co. v. McNeil- P. P.

Motivation to Exercise Consumer Care We first turn our attention to motivation for consumer care. There are both situational and intrapersonal factors that work to increase or decrease consumer motivation to exercise care. One key antecedent of motivation is a consumer‘ s level of involvement with the purchase or consumption situation. Another component of motivation— referred to in the literature as ? need for cognition? 69— is an enduring, intrapersonal trait that can directly influence a consumer‘ s motivation for care. We first detail the influence a consumer‘ s 69 John T. Cacioppo & Richard E. Petty, The Need for Cognition, 42 J. PERSONALITY & SOC. PSYCHOL. 116, 116 ( 1982).

Involvement In consumer research, a consumer‘ s level of product involvement is a heavily researched construct directly related to the consumer‘ s motivation to expend cognitive effort. 70 The perception of personal relevance or salience is the essential characteristic of involvement. 71 Consumers experience a psychological state of cognitive arousal referred to as high ? felt? involvement when they perceive a connection between themselves and the product, the brand, the product category, the consumption activity, or the purchase situation. 72 Highly involved consumers are highly motivated to exercise consumer care during the source- identification judgment. In contrast, many consumers perceive little connection between themselves and a product, which can be said to constitute a low level of involvement. Routine repurchases and impulse buys for low- cost items are prototypical examples of low- involvement situations. Low levels of felt involvement will not motivate a consumer to exercise consumer care. This does not suggest that consumers with low felt- involvement will necessarily have low motivation; other factors ( as described below) can influence motivation. Thus, what can be said is that that high levels of felt involvement increase motivation and low levels of felt involvement fail to increase motivation. 73 As developed in the consumer behavior literature, 74 there are two types of felt involvement: enduring involvement and situational involvement. As described below, the two types of involvement differ in terms of their antecedents and their consequences. 70 For an extensive review, see PIRJO LAAKSONEN, CONSUMER INVOLVEMENT: CONCEPTS AND RESEARCH ( 1994). 71 Richard L.

Enduring Involvement A consumer is said to have enduring involvement in a product that she is simply ? into?— whether by way of a hobby, an occupation, or some other enduring interest. 75 Such enduring involvement transcends any one specific encounter with the product ( such as the purchase situation) and motivates consumers across multiple product experiences and interactions. To give one example, Harley Davidson customers often have high enduring involvement— to the extent that their fixation and interest in the product and brand is based on their trans- situational interest in the product and its associated lifestyle. For such customers, Harley Davidson is a brand closely related to their personal identity and sense of self76 and, as such, acts as an intrinsic source of personal relevance77 that predisposes them to the experience of felt involvement across time and in varied contexts. 78 The expected universe of products for which any given consumer has high enduring involvement is relatively small. 79 b. Situational Involvement and Perceived Risk In contrast to enduring involvement, situational involvement is cued by the purchase situation, including those elements of the situation that are directly related to the perceived risk of purchasing and consuming the product. 80 Ceteris paribus, as a consumer perceives higher levels of risk in a purchase, she experiences higher levels of situational involvement81 and is, therefore, motivated to exercise greater consumer care during the source- identification judgment. 75 See Celsi & Olson, supra note 71, at 212. 76 See John W.

Bloch et al., Consumer Search: An Extended Framework, 13 J. CONSUMER RES. 119, 120 ( 1986) ( showing that consumers engage in greater and more careful product search when involvement is high). 592 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 An important distinction must be made between perceived risk and objective risk. All that is necessary to bring about situational involvement is for the consumer to perceive risk. 82 Whether the consumer‘ s risk perceptions are objectively correct is irrelevant. For example, if most consumers perceive little or no physical risk associated with the purchase and use of a new outdoor grill, expert testimony indicating that injuries related to outdoor grills are, in fact, commonplace would be irrelevant to situational involvement. For the same reason, commonly experienced consumer fears lead to perceptions of risk, even if those fears are irrational or objectively unfounded. Several types of perceived risk have been identified in the literature as impacting situational involvement. 83 For example, situational involvement increases when consumers perceive a heightened physical risk ( i. e., risk of bodily harm) in either the purchase or use of a product or service. 84 Additionally, perceptions of performance risk increase when there is greater uncertainty about whether a product will perform as expected. 85 Such perceptions are often related to product quality considerations. When a product is relatively expensive ( a perception that depends on the relationship between the price and the customer‘ s available funds), consumers‘ perceptions of financial risk increase. Thus, consumers buying an automobile typically perceive financial risk because the purchase is a large percentage of their households‘ disposable income. Time risk reflects the expected duration of the purchase process and the perceived length of ownership. 86 As the perceptions of the time horizon of ownership expands, so too does the perceived risk associated with the purchase situation. Thus, for most people, buying a durable good, such as a dishwasher, is situationally involving not only because it is relatively expensive, but also because consumers expect to live with the product for several years. Finally, social risk relates to the possible negative reactions of other people if the consumer purchases or consumes the product. 87 Because a gift- giver is typically trying to please another person, gift- giving inherently carries high social risk. Likewise, if a consumer judges that harm 82 See Vincent- Wayne Mitchell, Consumer Perceived Risk: Conceptualizations & Models, 33 EUROPEAN J. MARKETING, 163, 163– 95 ( 1995) ( discussing the relationship between perceived risk and the level of consumer involvement and trust, as well as the various models used to measure this relationship). 83 See Jacob Jacoby & Leon Kaplan, The Components of Perceived Risk, in 3 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RESEARCH, 382, 383 ( M. Venkatesan ed., 1972); Ted Roselius, Consumer Rankings of Risk Reduction Methods, 35 J.

In general, when the purchase or consumption of goods or services is interpersonally open to display, perceptions of social risk increase. 88 A high level of any of these five perceived risks causes consumers to be situationally involved and, therefore, motivated to exercise consumer care while making product judgments. In effect, the consumer carefully deliberates product judgments in the hope that the perceived risks of the buying situation will be mitigated. 2. Intrapersonal Trait Influences on Motivation The consumer psychology literature also suggests that consumers have traits that consistently impact motivation to exert cognitive effort across a variety of situations. For example, some consumers just enjoy thinking more than others. It is part of who they are. Research has identified among such consumers a high ? need for cognition.? 89 Consumers with a high need for cognition enjoy thinking deeply. They derive ? intrinsic enjoyment? from ? engaging in effortful information processing.? 90 They tend to exert cognitive effort to carefully consider consumer problems ( e. g., carefully considering the attributes and benefits of a product before purchasing it). 91 On the other hand, consumers with a low need for cognition do not enjoy exerting cognitive effort and tend to avoid exerting such effort whenever possible, preferring instead to rely on their intuitions and emotions as their guides. It must be emphasized that need for cognition is a motivational variable, not an ability variable. It is not necessarily the case that consumers in high need for cognition are more intelligent92 than their low need for cognition counterparts. 93 Consumers high 88 See, e. g., Cornelia Pechmann et al., What to Convey in Antismoking Advertisements for Adolescents: The Use of Protective Motivation Theory to Identify Effective Message Themes, 67 J. MARKETING 1, 1– 18 ( 2003) ( showing that anti- smoking advertisements showing severe social disapproval of smoking are more effective in curbing underage smoking than those that do not). 89 Cacioppo & Petty, supra note 69, at 116. 90 John T.

Cacioppo et al., Dispositional Differences in Cognitive Motivation: The Life and Times of Individuals Varying in Need for Cognition, 119 PSYCHOL. BULL. 197, 207 ( 1996) ( noting that correlations between the need for cognition and measures of intellectual ability have proved to be quite low, ranging from - 0.03 to 0.32). 594 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 in need for cognition do, however, enjoy cognition and thus are relatively more motivated to engage in extended thought. Relating the need for cognition to the idea of cognitive misers discussed previously, 94 it can be said that individuals who are high in need for cognition are less miserly in their exertion of cognitive effort than individuals who are low in need for cognition. Need for cognition is a stable intrapersonal trait variable that has a reliable influence on a person‘ s motivation to allocate cognitive effort. Research suggests that as compared to consumers who are low in need for cognition, those who are high in need for cognition engage more thoroughly in information search95 regarding potential purchases and respond differently to advertising and other persuasive campaigns. 96 Consumers high in need for cognition tend to focus on substantive message components in advertisements and ignore extraneous information, such as attractive photographs, humor, and celebrity spokespeople. 97 Thus, a consumer‘ s need for cognition is an enduring trait predisposition that likely correlates in general terms with Barton Beebe‘ s notion of ? search? sophistication. 98 Consumers high in need for cognition search for information more extensively and process the information they find more carefully. 99 Need for cognition is of legal relevance because consumers differing in their need for cognition can be expected to have differing product interests. For example, consumers high in need for cognition may gravitate toward products and consumption experiences that provide opportunities for the exertion of cognitive effort, such as chess, strategy games, educational experiences and television shows like Jeopardy. 100 Because a high need for cognition is likely commonplace among consumers of such products, motivation for care will be relatively higher in markets of such product categories, thus reducing ( ceteris paribus) the likelihood of confusion. 94 See supra text accompanying note 62. 95 Bas Verplanken et al., Need for Cognition and External Information Search Effort, 26 J.

MACINNIS, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 381 ( 4th ed. 2007). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 595 B. Ability to Exercise Consumer Care As noted above, high motivation is a necessary but insufficient condition for a consumer to exercise a high degree of care when performing the source- identification judgment. The other necessary but insufficient condition is the consumer‘ s ability to exercise consumer care. As with the motivational construct, and as presented in Figure 1, both situational and intrapersonal factors influence a consumer‘ s ability to exercise consumer care and thereby influence the likelihood that an individual consumer will suffer from source confusion. Situational influences on ability are discussed under the rubric of ? opportunity,? whereas intrapersonal trait influences on ability are denominated ? capacity? and ? capability.? Ability is generally defined in the consumer behavior literature as the extent to which the consumer has available the cognitive resources requisite to exercise consumer care during information processing and decision making. 101 To claim that the consumer‘ s ability is high is to assert that when making the source- identification judgment, the consumer is capable of gathering whatever information is desired, capable of comprehending and considering the information, and capable of exerting the cognitive effort necessary to systematically and thoroughly make the source- identification judgment. If the consumer‘ s ability is low, she will be inhibited in her ability to exercise consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 102 1. Situational Influences on Ability: Opportunity Situational factors that constrain the ability of consumers to engage in extended cognition, and thus exercise consumer care, include distracting environments, limited information, limited opportunities for comparison, incomprehensible information, and restrictions on time. 103 Concomitantly, multiple exposures to relevant information across decision experiences can enhance consumers‘ opportunities to exercise consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 104 101 See, e. g., Deborah J. Maclnnis & Bernard J. Jaworski, Information Processing from Advertisements: Toward an Integrative Framework, 53 J. MARKETING 1, 6– 7 ( 1989). 102 Id. at 7. 103 Id. 104 Id. 596 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 a. Distracting Environments Distraction is any aspect of the purchase environment that diverts cognitive resources and attention away from pertinent information. 105 Background music can act as a distraction that inhibits opportunity to engage in extended thought. 106 For example, as a consumer at a bar attempts to choose from a long list of lagers, she may be distracted by the bar‘ s loud music. Similarly, loud noise and physical discomfort, such as illness, misbehaving children, and scents in the air, 107 can all act as distractions in a purchasing environment. Also, aggressive salespeople often distract consumers from the opportunity for thought afforded by a self- paced information search and deliberation by interrupting with questions and conversation. 108 The result of such distractions is that consumers have less opportunity to exercise consumer care during the source- identification judgment, thereby increasing the likelihood of source confusion. 109 b. Limited Information Purchase environments may also limit the opportunity of consumers to gather information that would be relevant to the source- identification judgment, thereby reducing the opportunity to effectively perform the judgment. 110 For example, when making in- home purchases ( e. g., as with e- commerce), buyers cannot physically inspect the item before purchase. Similarly, some types of retail display cases inhibit physical inspection. 111 Physical inspection is the primary way of obtaining information for products 105 Scott B.

PERSONAL SELLING & SALES MGMT. 35, 36 ( 1993) ( describing effective salespeople as those who exhibit good listening skills, including an avoidance of interrupting customers). 109 See MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 7. 110 See id. 111 Joann Peck & Terry L.

Such physical information may strongly indicate source identity, so preventing the gathering of such information can inhibit consumers from effectively making the source- identification judgment. c. Limited Opportunity to Compare Information Consumers may also be inhibited in their opportunity to compare information about the junior and senior trademarks. Limited retail distribution makes such inhibition commonplace. 113 If a retailer offers for sale items bearing both the junior and senior trademark, shoppers will have ample opportunity to compare the items ? side by side,? while making a source- identification judgment. If, however, the retailer offers for sale only the junior trademark, shoppers are inhibited in their opportunity to compare the junior and senior trademarks, thus reducing shoppers‘ opportunity to exercise care when making the source- identification judgment. For example, if a consumer shops at a retailer that offers for sale Converz shoes, but not Converse shoes, the consumer will be less able to compare information about the junior and the senior trademarks and will, therefore, be less able to exert consumer care ( as compared to a consumer shopping at a retailer that sells both Converz and Converse shoes). d. Incomprehensible Information Even if product information is readily available, consumers will be inhibited in their opportunity to process the information if it is presented in a way that is difficult to comprehend. 114 For example, even if the product labeling on the junior trademark explicitly describes differences between it and 112 See Joann Peck & Jennifer Wiggins, It Just Feels Good: Customers? Affective Response to Touch and Its Influence on Persuasion, 70 J. MARKETING 56, 56– 57 ( 2006) ( describing the important role physical characteristics of the product play in communicating salient information about the product such as the gel finger- grip on the Paper Mate Dynagrip pen). 113 See MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 3, 7 ( describing the essential role of opportunity in product evaluation); see also Beatty & Smith, supra note 81, at 84 ( showing that greater retail distribution enhances opportunity information search and comparative evaluation while limited retail distribution impedes opportunity); Guliz Ger, Richard Belk & Dana- Nicoleta Lascu, The Development of Consumer Desire in Marketing and Developing Economies, 20 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RES. 102, 107 ( 1993) ( describing that when products and brands are scarcely distributed, information is limited and opportunity for processing is inhibited). 114 MacInnis & Jaworski, supra note 101, at 7. 598 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 the senior trademark, if the label contains obscure technical jargon ( common with products such as home theater equipment), numeric data ( common with products such as dietary supplements), 115 or a foreign language ( common with products such as French perfumes), the consumer will have reduced opportunity to perform the source- identification judgment. e. Restrictions on Time Harried consumers under time pressure will have limited opportunity to carefully consider product information. 116 Consumer research has shown that time- pressured consumers use shallow, heuristic processing and consider a more limited array of product information. 117 Opportunity is also limited by time when information is presented in short bursts and limited- duration windows, 118 and when consumers cannot control their own rate of exposure to information ( as with ads playing on radio and television). 119 f. Frequency of Exposure In contrast to the many situational factors that can act to inhibit opportunity, 120 one situational factor acts to increase opportunity: multiple exposures to relevant information. 121 For example, seeing an advertisement or a retail display multiple times increases the opportunity for the information to be considered while the consumer performs the source- identification judgment. Also, if there are many overt steps required to enact a purchase, the opportunity for exposure to relevant information is increased. For example, if a consumer desires to purchase a prescription drug after viewing a direct- to- consumer advertisement sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, the 115 Richard F.

Each step in the purchase process gives the consumer more opportunity to make ( and refine) a source- identification judgment. 2. Intrapersonal Influences on Ability: Capacity and Capability Beyond situational influences on consumers‘ ability to exercise consumer care, a customer comes to a purchase situation with traits that can either enable or inhibit her ability. This intrapersonal, enduring cognitive ability can be bifurcated in an important way: capacity and capability to exercise consumer care. To understand these distinctions more clearly, it is useful to think of capacity as a ? hardware? aspect of cognition and capability as ? software.? 122 The ? hardware? aspect, like a computer, refers to the state or capacity ? of the machine?— how much processing power or ability does the consumer bring to a purchase situation? 123 Some computers simply have faster hardware than others. The ? software? aspect, as the metaphor suggests, refers to the existence of past experience, knowledge structures, memories, and expertise available to the consumer when exerting cognitive effort as part of mental processes. 124 In this sense, capability as ? software? refers to the memory structures the mind can use to compare, contrast, counter argue, confirm, integrate, and, in other ways, elaborate upon during the consumer decisionmaking process. 125 a. Capacity for Exercising Consumer Care: “ Hardware” Consumer behavior studies suggest that intelligence, education, and age are all directly related to a person‘ s capacity to exercise consumer care. Higher levels of intelligence endow the consumer with greater processing capacity. 126 Further, much like an upgrade in hardware processing power, greater educational attainment is shown to advance intelligence by improving processing strategies, problem- solving skills, and the ability to parse and apprehend complex information. 127 122 Arie W. Kruglanski et al., Separate or Equal?: Bimodal Notions of Persuasion and a Single Process “ Unimodel,” in DUAL- PROCESS THEORIES IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 293, 298– 99 ( Shelly Chaiken & Yaacov Trope eds., 1999). 123 Id. at 299. 124 Id. at 298. 125 Id. 126 See Rolph E.

EDUC., 17, 17– 18 ( 2007). 600 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 Age has also been correlated with cognitive capacity, but in a non- monotonic way. The consumer behavior literature suggests that cognitive capacity increases from childhood to adulthood, but eventually declines due to the effects of aging. 128 Graphically, the relationship can be expressed in an ? inverted U- curve? as cognitive capacity for elaborative processing is plotted against cognitive development. The cognitive abilities of young children are still developing, giving them reduced capacity to apprehend and consider market information. 129 Furthermore, elderly consumers have been shown to commonly experience diminished cognitive skills and thus a reduced capacity to process market information. 130 b. Capability for Exercising Consumer Care: “ Software” Continuing the metaphor introduced earlier, the ? software? aspects of innate cognitive skill relate to a consumer‘ s capability to exercise consumer care. ? Capability refers to the knower‘ s possession of active cognitive structures ( i. e., knowledge structures available in memory) wherein the reasoning process from evidence to conclusion may be carried out.? 131 Thus, having relatively more extensive knowledge of a particular product or product category ( i. e., greater consumer expertise132) provides an individual‘ s processing- ability ? hardware? something to relate to the information in the environment. 133 In fact, having previous experience with and knowledge of a product and its product category facilitates the acquisition of new information regarding that product and category, while also increasing the efficiency134 and accuracy135 of the information search. 128 See, e. g., Yany Gregoire, The Impact of Aging on Consumer Responses: What Do We Know?, 30 ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RES. 19, 22 ( 2003). 129 Id. at 19. 130 Catherine A.

CONSUMER RES. 190, 190– 207 ( 1993). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 601 Individuals develop more elaborate knowledge structures around what they experience more frequently. 136 On this point, the situational influence of repeated encounters with relevant market information ( e. g., during consumer decisions that require multiple steps to complete) interacts with the development of knowledge structures to facilitate the performance of the source- identification judgment. Thus, consumers who purchase the same product frequently have greater knowledge in that category, which amounts to an increase in capability. Similarly, consumers exposed to repeated advertising are more likely to develop richer product knowledge structures that are facilitative of consumer care. 137 In sum, the consumer behavior literature suggests that if an individual lacks either motivation or ability to expend cognitive effort while making the source- identification judgment, she will perform the judgment in a haphazard and offhand manner, resulting in an increased likelihood of confusion. A consumer may be motivated to exercise a high degree of care by any one of a number of factors: enduring involvement, situational involvement ( precipitated by risk perceptions), or need for cognition. A consumer‘ s ability to exercise a high degree of care may be inhibited by distractions in the shopping environment, limited availability of information, limited opportunity to compare the junior and senior trademarks, incomprehensible information, and restrictions on time. Conversely, a consumer‘ s ability can be increased through multiple exposures to product information and a multiple- step purchase process. As described in the next Part, these principles allow detailed predictions regarding the circumstances in which consumers can be expected to experience source confusion. III. THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR MODEL AS A CONSTRUCT FOR EVALUATING JUDICIAL CONCEPTIONS OF CONSUMER SOPHISTICATION AND CARE The judicial evaluation of consumer ? care? and ? sophistication? has not, as yet, tapped into the insights of the consumer behavior literature. Instead, the case law in this field has unfolded in an unsystematic, ad hoc manner, with the courts being guided by intuition and ( eventually) precedent, and not by any comprehensive theoretical principles. Thus, there is a fundamental disconnect between a field of law that is premised on assumptions about consumer behavior and a well- developed body of literature studying those very 136 C. Whan Park et al., Consumer Knowledge Assessment, 21 J. CONSUMER RES. 71, 71 ( 1994). 137 See Alba & Hutchinson, supra note 132, at 415– 17. 602 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 assumptions. This is unfortunate, as the consumer behavior model provides powerful theoretical tools for understanding and analyzing judicial intimations about consumer sophistication. We seek to remedy this disconnect here. In the sections below, we evaluate some of the principal strands of the consumer sophistication case law through the lens of the consumer behavior model. The discussion proceeds on two levels. On some points, we offer a ? positive? analysis of the case law, which, though built on intuition and without any comprehensive theoretical foundation, turns out in many respects to find support in the consumer behavior model. To this extent, the contribution of our model is to provide a sound framework for understanding the existing case law and thus to facilitate its evolution and development over time. Second, in other instances, we find the case law‘ s intuitive assessments to be faulty, or at least shortsighted, and to this extent we offer a ? normative? analysis. On these issues, we propose a change in the direction of the current case law— a change that is necessary where sound theoretical principles contradict ad hoc judicial intuition. The sections below address several lines of cases in which the courts have evaluated the degree of consumer care or sophistication. Specifically, we consider cases in which the courts have identified price, length and complexity of the purchase transaction, frequency of purchase, education, age, and income as factors relevant to the expected degree of consumer care, as well as cases in which the target market consists of professional buyers or avid hobbyists. Our analysis of these cases demonstrates that the consumer is neither the ? fool,? as the apologist commentator would have it, nor the informed ? sovereign,? as the restrictionists posit. Instead, the consumer exhibits characteristics of both, depending on the circumstances. She devotes extensive cognitive energy to the source- identification judgment only where she is motivated and able to do so; where either or both of these preconditions are absent, her involvement in source- identification will be limited— not because she is a ? fool? or a ? presumptive idiot,? but because she is following the same human tendencies that we all possess. 138 138 See generally, Adam Benforado & Jon Hanson, The Great Attributional Divide: How Divergent Views of Human Behavior Are Shaping Legal Policy, 57 EMORY L. J. 311 ( 2008) ( Discussing the causes and effects of these tendencies). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 603 A. Price The courts have long embraced the notion that consumer care is affected by price. Where ? goods or services are relatively expensive,? the courts anticipate that ? more care is taken? at the point of purchase and that ? buyers are less likely to be confused as to source or affiliation.? 139 As one court put it, ? the average purchaser of an automobile will no doubt devote more attention to examining different products and determining the manufacturer or source than will the average purchaser of a ball of twine.? 140 Examples of expensive items thought to indicate high consumer involvement include boats, 141 cameras, 142 high- end home exercise equipment, 143 guitars, 144 sound design services, 145 trade association memberships, 146 cruise ship tickets, 147 waste- water treatment devices, 148 mortgages, 149 golf club memberships, 150 and real estate. 151 Conversely, where the ? products are relatively low- priced and subject to impulse buying, the risk of likelihood of confusion is increased.? 152 For example, ? inexpensive snack foods? are expected to be ? purchased with little care? under circumstances where consumer confusion is likely. 153 By the same token, ?[ t] he ordinary purchaser of bread and margarine is a casual buyer,? 139 Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v.

According to this model, price is correlated positively with perceived financial risk. Thus, holding all other factors constant, as price increases so does situational involvement— an antecedent of the consumer‘ s motivation to exert consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. To this extent, the courts‘ intuitive assessment of the relevance of price rests on sound theoretical footing. That is not to say that the consumer behavior model supports the notion of designating price as a dispositive factor. While higher prices generally are thought to heighten perceptions of financial risk for most consumers, consumer behavior theory reveals that the level of involvement is not intrinsic to the product, but is relative to the consumer as the perceiver. In other words, involvement is in the eye of the consumer and not intrinsic to product or service per se. It is a bit of a misnomer to call an expensive good a ? high- involvement product.? Thus, the consumer behavior model suggests an important adjustment to the courts‘ treatment of price as a proxy for consumer sophistication. Under our model, price may correlate with the level of care exercised by the consumer, but only to the extent that the financial risk- factor identified in the involvement construct outweighs any other relevant involvement factors that may point in the other direction.

For certain products like apparel and jewelry, for example, high involvement may be cued not only because of the financial risks associated with high price, but also in light of the potential social risks presented. 163 For other products, like high- end climbing equipment, the involvement motivation flowing from the financial risks associated with a hefty price tag would be reinforced by physical risks. 164 In some situations and market segments, however, we might expect an expensive product to be a low- involvement purchase; in other circumstances, we might expect high involvement, even in the purchase of relatively inexpensive items. Even a low- priced item might rate high on the motivation scale, for example, if it presents significant physical risks. In situations where the use of the product or service may involve the potential for tangible harm, consumers generally will be more situationally involved and process relevant information more systematically and carefully. 165 In the following sections, we identify circumstances in which ( 1) even high- priced goods cannot be expected to engender sufficient levels of exercised care; and ( 2) low- priced goods might nonetheless produce incentives for exercised care. 1. High- Prices, Yet Insufficient Levels of Consumer Care Our model provides a framework for identifying circumstances where even high- priced goods may not be expected to produce consumer care that is sufficient to dispel confusion. First, high prices will trigger motivation for care only where they give rise to perceived financial risk. Thus, the significance of 163 See J. R. Wood & Sons v. Reese Jewelry Corp., 278 F. 2d 157, 159 ( 2d Cir. 1960) ( finding sophistication on the part of consumers of wedding and engagement rings); see also E. T. F. Enters., Inc. v. Nina Ricci, S. A. R. L., 523 F. Supp. 1147, 1156 ( S. D. N. Y. 1981) ( asserting that fashion- conscious customers of clothing, fragrances, and accessories ? are not likely to be misled by two marks which share the same surname but have different first names?). 164 See S. Indus., Inc. v. Stone Age Equip., Inc., 12 F. Supp. 2d 796, 816 ( N. D. Ill. 1998) ( noting that ?[ s] electing a shoe to wear for climbing treacherous peaks . . . requires careful examination and inquiry about the sole‘ s gripping characteristics and ability to withstand these extraordinary uses,? and concluding that ? at $ 140 a pair, customers will not make the purchase lightly?); see also Bioglan Inc. v. Bioglan Labs. Ltd., 44 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1662, 1667 ( C. D. Cal. 1997) ( indicating that purchasers of healthcare- related products are likely to exercise some degree of care); Blansett Pharmacal Co. v. Carmrick Labs. Inc., 25 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1473, 1477 ( T. T. A. B. 1992) ( applying the ? doctrine of greater care? in asserting that it is more important to avoid confusion with respect to pharmaceuticals because of the potential for serious medical consequences). But see Eli Lilly & Co. v. Natural Answers, Inc., 233 F. 3d 456, 464 ( 7th Cir. 2000) ( suggesting that ? there is just no evidence that consumers as a whole are extraordinarily careful when it comes to dietary supplements?). 165 See Celsi, supra note 84, at 1– 23 ( detailing the extent of involvement exhibited by consumers purchasing and participating in high- physical- risk consumption). 606 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 price in the consumer- care function should be evaluated relative to the income or wealth of the target demographic. If a certain product is targeted at a particularly wealthy clientele, a price tag that might seem high to an average consumer— i. e., one that would generate perceived financial risk— may not have the same effect. 166 Second, even where a consumer‘ s perception of financial risk is high, the model does not predict a high level of consumer care where there are significant constraints on opportunity for care. After all, motivation is only one factor in the consumer care function; even a motivated consumer will not be careful if her ability to be careful is limited by environmental constraints. Consider the case of Karen J. Connelly, S. Y. K., LLC v. ValueVision Media, Inc., 167 where the court assessed the degree of care expected of consumers of jewelry sold through ? home shopping? television outlets. 168 Although the jewelry was ? not inexpensive ( ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars),? the court nonetheless concluded that consumers of such items were not sophisticated. 169 The court based its conclusion on its understanding of the ? nature of home shopping, where consumers do not actually inspect items prior to purchase.? 170 This analysis can be translated in terms of our model in opportunity terms. The television home shopping context may be one in which a consumer‘ s motivation for enhanced involvement in a high- priced ( and thus high- financial- risk) purchase might be overcome by the consumer‘ s reduced opportunity to gather information by physically inspecting the product prior to purchase, thus reducing their ability to engage in extended cognition. Thus, the home shopping buyer of jewelry may be sufficiently motivated to be careful, but constraints on opportunity may still give reason to rate the level of consumer care as relatively low. 171 166 At least one court has proffered the converse conclusion ( albeit without pinpointing the issue as one of ? perceived risk?). See Reebok Intern. Ltd. v. K- Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 252, 268 ( S. D. N. Y. 1994) (? In fact, an argument can be made that shoppers with limited budgets use more care in spending their more limited resources than shoppers at non- discount stores.?). 167 2004 WL 2569494 ( D. Minn. Nov. 9, 2004). 168 Id. at * 1. 169 Id. at * 7. 170 Id. 171 As explained in greater detail infra notes 215– 16, there may be reason to be skeptical about the effect of such constraints on opportunity. The very context identified by the court— the home shopping environment in which ? consumers do not actually inspect items prior to purchase?— may further enhance a consumer‘ s motivation for extended cognition. Karen J. Connelly, S. Y. K., LLC, 2004 WL 2569494, at * 7. Specifically, in the context of a jewelry purchase in a home- shopping environment, the consumer has limited information about the product that she purchases, little confidence in or experience with the product, and an expectation of 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 607 Even where financial risk is not outweighed by other elements, the model identifies additional grounds for rejecting the usual presumption that high price will engender care sufficient to reduce the likelihood of confusion. Under the model, the exercise of consumer care is relevant only to the extent that the exertion of additional cognitive effort can be expected to dispel confusion. If it will not, as in a case involving identical marks in direct competition with each other, even a relatively high degree of consumer care will not be sufficient. This analysis explains decisions like Omega Importing Corp. v. Petri- Kine Camera Co., 172 in which the court found a likelihood of confusion arising out of the junior‘ s use of the EXAKTA trademark in direct competition with the senior‘ s use of the identical trademark on high- priced cameras. 173 Although the court acknowledged that ? the cameras here in question are expensive items? with respect to which the ? purchaser would be expected to make more than a casual inspection of the product before buying,? 174 the court found that ? purchaser inspection would be of doubtful value.? 175 This conclusion is consistent with our model. If even relatively high levels of cognition cannot dispel confusion between facially identical trademarks, then high price is simply beside the point. 2. Low- Prices, but High Levels of Consumer Care Sometimes, even low- priced goods can rate high on the involvement scale, such as in cases where alternative considerations introduce ? perceived risk? beyond that associated with high price. Worthington Foods v. Kellogg Co. 176 arguably presents one example. In that case, the court concluded that ? heightened awareness of health and healthy foods raises the standard of care which the reasonable purchaser of [ healthy foods] would exercise.? 177 Thus, although HEARTWISE brand breakfast foods are a low- priced product, they need not reflexively be dumped in the ? low consumer- sophistication? basket, an extended experience with a purchase that may involve strong self- presentation aspects. All of these factors will tend to heighten the perceived risks of the purchase ( adding performance and social risks to the financial risk already perceived), such that the consumer may be sufficiently motivated to find creative ways to overcome the time limitations of the home shopping environment— such as by waiting until the product is offered a second time or pursuing alternative channels, such as an internet website or toll- free number. 172 451 F. 2d 1190 ( 2d Cir. 1971). 173 Id. at 1195. 174 Id. 175 Id. 176 732 F. Supp. 1417 ( S. D. Ohio 1990). 177 Id. at 1448. 608 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 since the physical risk associated with buying purportedly health- conscious foods may enhance the motivation for the exercise of consumer care, even if price alone does not increase consumer perceptions of financial risk. 178 There may also be circumstances where the financial risk persists even where the price of the product in question is low. Consider the case of Reed- Union Corp. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 179 in which the court found that a purchase of inexpensive car polish was nevertheless likely to involve relatively high levels of sophistication. 180 The court‘ s explanation— that this inexpensive product was to be used on an expensive possession ( a car) 181— can easily be restated in terms of the motivation factor: Price is only part of the perceived financial risk associated with some purchases, and where use of the product could have a substantial impact on the value of another product, even low- priced purchases may present significant financial risk and thus a high level of situational involvement. Finally, there may be other low- priced products that would be naturally dominated by high ? need for cognition? consumers who would be intrinsically attracted to a product that gives them a chance to exert cognitive effort. Sudoku and other ? brain teaser? puzzle books, for example, present low financial risk, but the typical consumer of such products would likely possess a high need for cognition that would suggest higher levels of care regardless of low perceptions of financial risk. Thus, our model suggests some reason to doubt the conclusions of some courts that consumers of such products rate low on the consumer care scale. 182 178 The apparent perception of this sort of risk might be dampened, however, by the proliferation of purportedly healthy products available to consumers. If consumers are bombarded by health claims, they may tend to discount them, and thus not perceive any risk that would enhance their motivation for extended cognition. 179 869 F. Supp. 1304 ( N. D. Ill. 1994), aff? d, 77 F. 3d 909 ( 7th Cir. 1996); see also Life Indus. Corp. v.

Length and Complexity of the Purchase Transaction A second factor frequently identified in the case law is the length and complexity of the purchase process. The more time the consumer is expected to devote to purchasing a particular product, the more care she is expected to take. There are two distinct strands of cases: ( 1) those where the courts have attempted to identify products that are by their very nature likely to be the subject of an ? impulse? purchase; and ( 2) those where the courts have examined the complexity of the purchasing process to determine whether a consumer is likely to engage in high levels of consumer care. Examples of products deemed inherently ? impulsive? include magazines ( because consumers are thought to purchase them based on the cover or title), 183 snack foods ( since consumers may purchase them without putting them on their grocery lists), 184 and fast food ( which is purchased when consumers are in a hurry). 185 With respect to the purchasing process, the courts have sometimes correlated low levels of consumer care with quick or hurried transactions. For example, at least one court has suggested that direct- order television advertisements (? infomercials?) involve low- care, impulse purchases, since such ? advertising is directed toward those persons who tend to buy on impulse when they see a product on television which appeals to them at a reasonable price.? 186 Another court offered a similar assessment of the low level of care typically exercised in the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of a typical supermarket.? 187 of lectures on great philosophers by leading contemporary scholars, against defendant selling documentary films under the GREAT MINDS mark). 183 See Brockmeyer v. Hearst Corp., 248 F. Supp. 2d 281, 299 ( S. D. N. Y. 2003) ( generalizing that magazines are impulse purchases); see also Playboy Enter., Inc. v. Chuckleberry Publ‘ g, Inc., 687 F. 2d 563, 570 ( 2d Cir. 1982) ( finding that magazine subtitles contribute greatly to impulse buying). 184 See Gray v. Meijer, Inc., 295 F. 3d 641, 649– 50 ( 6th Cir. 2002) ( determining that buyers of inexpensive snack foods do not exercise a high degree of care); Beer Nuts, Inc., v. Clover Club Foods Co., 805 F. 2d 920, 926– 27 ( 10th Cir. 1986) ( finding that there is a high likelihood of confusion in purchasing a snack- nut mix because consumers exercise little care when purchasing competing brands ? Beer Nuts? and ? Brew Nuts?— those items are impulse purchases that are not generally on the consumer‘ s grocery list). 185 See Frisch‘ s Rests. v. Elby‘ s Big Boy, 670 F. 2d 642, 648 ( 6th Cir. 1982) ( finding a casual degree of care in ? impulse buying? of fast food items); Burger Chef Sys., Inc. v. Burger Man, Inc., 492 F. 2d 1398, 1399 ( C. C. P. A. 1974) ( describing fast- food customers as on the move and in a hurry). 186 Telebrands Corp. v. E. Mishan & Sons, 46 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1493, 1508 ( S. D. N. Y. 1997). 187 Lever Bros. v. Am. Bakeries Co., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 248, 255 ( E. D. N. Y. 1982) ( concluding that ? the ordinary purchaser of AUTUMN margarine and AUTUMN GRAIN bread is a casual, unsophisticated buyer,? and an atmosphere ? in which over 5,000 trademarked items are presented? is unlikely to be conducive to a high level of consumer care). 610 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 Conversely, the courts have also identified circumstances where the purchasing environment is conducive to ( or even requires) the exercise of high levels of consumer care. In Star Industries v. Bacardi & Co., 188 for example, the court concluded that liquor store purchases are not likely to constrain levels of consumer care— in light of the store‘ s generally relaxed environment as compared to a supermarket. 189 Alternatively, the courts have found sophistication in circumstances involving extended negotiation and interaction with sales personnel. Examples of purchases deemed to involve this sort of sophistication run the gamut from lawn and garden equipment to perfume. 190 The assumption is that trained personnel can be expected to ? help[] inform customers of the differences in the products.? 191 Elsewhere, the courts have concluded that inherently complex transactions can be expected to involve high levels of care. Under this analysis, the courts have held that consumers of certain financial instruments are ? sophisticated? because of the steps required to complete a transaction through a financial institution. 192 On similar analysis, the courts have anticipated high levels of care in the purchase of a health care plan. 193 188 412 F. 3d 373 ( 2d Cir. 2005). 189 Id. at 390 ( differentiating the ? rough and tumble? atmosphere at grocery stores from the ? relaxed environment of the liquor store,? where unhurried customers will ? exhibit sufficient sophistication? to distinguish between different stylized scripts on the competing brands‘ labels, thus decreasing likelihood of confusion). Alcoholic beverages are one product category where the courts have sent conflicting signals as to the expected level of consumer care. The conflict in the case law is discussed in some detail infra notes 252– 57. 190 See, e. g., Deere & Co. v. MTD Holdings, Inc., 70 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1009, 1023 ( S. D. N. Y. 2004) ( finding that consumer interaction with sales personnel when purchasing expensive lawn and garden maintenance equipment would help to dispel confusion, such that purchasers of such equipment are deemed to exercise a higher degree of care); Conopco, Inc. v.

May 21, 1996) ( stating that because of the time and effort consumers spend evaluating different health care plans, consumer naivety as to the different plans available decreases, so consumers are deemed more sophisticated). 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 611 The consumer behavior model provides a useful framework for evaluating these cases. The impulse- product cases are most naturally evaluated under the motivation construct, which suggests that ? impulse? purchases will be those that present little perceived risk. The purchase- process cases implicate the ability construct and the question of whether and to what extent the purchasing environment requires, permits, or limits opportunities for the exercise of care during the source- identification judgment. As a general matter, we find that judicial intuitions in these cases find support in the theoretical foundations of the model. We also conclude, however, that the model provides a basis for questioning the results in some of the cases and— more broadly— some cautionary limits on further development of the jurisprudence. As with price, we find that judicial intuitions with respect to the time and complexity of the purchase process veer off course where the courts focus myopically on any single factor in the consumer care function. A reliable assessment of the degree of consumer care requires a complete consideration of all of the elements of the consumer behavior model, and the analysis is distorted ( as in some of the cases highlighted below) where the courts focus on isolated elements of the model to the exclusion of others. 1. “ Impulse Products,” Motivation, and Risk According to the consumer behavior model, products likely to be purchased on ? impulse? are those that present relatively little motivation for the exercise of consumer care. There is some overlap with the price factor discussed above: impulse items will tend to be low in price and thus present little financial risk. But the involvement construct allows us to generalize the ? impulse? category beyond price: ? impulse? purchases should be defined to encompass products that present minimal motivation for involvement across any of the various risk factors ( financial, performance, physical, and social). Thus, under the model, impulse items would encompass lower- cost items that are consumed within a short horizon, that the consumer is relatively familiar with, and for which perceived social and physical risk are relatively low. 194 Much of the ? impulse product? case law finds support in this analysis. Magazines, snack foods, and fast food meet the foregoing criteria; thus, they are likely to present minimal risk ( whether financial, performance, physical, or 194 See RICHARD P. BAGOZZI, PRINCIPLES OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT 61– 63 ( 1986). 612 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 social) and consequently present little motivation for the exercise of consumer care. The model also provides a limiting principle, however, and thus a basis for confining the ? impulse product? categories to their proper bounds. Although impulse products ordinarily implicate a low level of motivation for consumer care, that will not always be so. 195 Consider health food items. Should such purchases be deemed to involve low levels of consumer care, at least where they may fall under the ? snack food? or ? fast food? categories? Perhaps not. The question is whether these items present some element of risk as a motivation for the exercise of consumer care— not whether they can fit into some abstract category of ? fast food? or ? snack food.? At least one court has suggested that consumers may be expected to ? purchase = healthy‘ products quickly, but not impulsively or carelessly.? 196 That conclusion is at least arguably consistent with a careful parsing of the involvement construct: such products may not present any significant financial risk or time commitment in the purchase transaction, but they may implicate an element of physical risk that may enhance the motivation for the exercise of consumer care while making the source- identification judgment. 197 In the health- food niche, consumers may be assumed to be more concerned about physical risk, and thus to expend greater cognitive resources than they would if they were focused only on the ( minimal) financial risk associated with a snack food purchase. Thus, the ? impulse product? question should be evaluated based on the degree of relative risk factors as motivations for extended involvement, not on blind adherence to precedents identifying broad product categories deemed forever likely to be purchased on impulse. Some items, such as condoms, would by their nature and use create high involvement and time investment with their purchase because they produce, for 195 Recall the Sudoku example above, supra text accompanying note 182, of low- priced products aimed at a customer base that is high in ? need for cognition.? The point is that perceived financial risk is only one trigger for motivation for consumer care. Where other triggers are present, a product that may ordinarily be thought of as an impulse purchase may nevertheless involve a high degree of consumer care. 196 See Luigino‘ s, Inc. v. Stouffer Corp., 170 F. 3d 827, 831 ( 8th Cir. 1999). 197 See Stouffer Corp. v. Health Valley Natural Foods, Inc., 1 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1900, 1902 ( T. T. A.

The enduring involvement concept is discussed in greater detail infra notes 198– 207. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 613 many consumers, heightened perceptions of risk ( physical, social, etc.) leading to the exercise of high levels of consumer care. A similar example identified in the case law is shoes. At least one court has suggested that even though shoes may be relatively low- priced, they may not properly be classifiable as an impulse item. 198 The court‘ s conclusions can be understood in terms of the motivation construct: shoes may present physical and social risk as motivations for involvement even if they do not entail any significant financial risk. 199 2. Purchase Processes and Effects on Opportunity for the Exertion of Consumer Care In the purchase- process cases, the courts have identified purchasing environments that facilitate, foreclose, or even require opportunities for the exercise of consumer care. These cases implicate the ability element of the consumer behavior model, which explains that consumer care may be affected not only by motivation, but also by the degree of opportunity to engage in extended cognition. This construct provides an analytical foundation for understanding these cases. But it also provides a limiting principle to guide the development of the case law and for questioning some of the outcomes in the cases. a. Unconstrained Opportunity In Star Industries, Inc. v. Bacardi & Co., 200 the court concluded that the relaxed atmosphere of a liquor store would facilitate consumer care and that consumers in that environment would not likely be confused by defendant Bacardi‘ s use of an elliptical, stylized ? O? trademark on its orange- flavored rum— a mark that purportedly was confusingly similar to plaintiff Star Industries‘ elliptical, stylized ? O? mark on its orange- flavored vodka. 201 This analysis finds an initial foothold in the opportunity element of the ability construct: Consumers who feel at ease in a purchasing environment will not have any limitations placed on their ability to exercise a high degree of 198 See Reebok Int‘ l Ltd. v. K- Mart Corp., 849 F. Supp. 252, 268 ( S. D. N. Y. 1994). 199 Id. at 268 ( noting that ? shoes are an item worn daily? that ? can lead a customer to experience ongoing discomfort and physical pain,? and are thus ? much less likely to be the subject of impulse purchases than other low priced consumer goods or consumables?). 200 412 F. 3d 373 ( 2d Cir. 2005). 201 Id. at 390. 614 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 consumer care. This uninhibited opportunity stands in contrast to the ? bustling . . . atmosphere of a typical supermarket.? 202 The Star Industries court‘ s analysis is flawed ( or at least incomplete), however, in ways that are illuminated by a broader understanding of the consumer behavior model. Ability is a necessary— but not sufficient— condition for the exercise of consumer care, in that a consumer who has all of the opportunity in the world will not be careful unless she has sufficient motivation to do so. For that reason, without a consideration of the motivation of typical consumers, it cannot reliably be said that [ u] nhurried consumers in the relaxed environment of the liquor store may be expected to educate themselves sufficiently to recognize the respective brand names, to understand the respective stature of the two companies, and thus to understand how fanciful the notion is that Bacardi would seek the benefit of Star‘ s reputation and good will by entering into a licensing agreement to secure utilization of its ? O? design. 203 The ? unhurried? environment gives liquor purchasers an opportunity ? to educate themselves sufficiently? and to be careful enough ? to understand? the lack of any association between Bacardi and Star, but that unconstrained ability alone is insufficient. The key question is whether they will have the motivation to do so. They will if they perceive sufficient risk ( such as financial or perhaps social risk associated with the liquor purchase), but otherwise, no amount of uninhibited, ? unhurried? opportunity will yield this degree of the exercise of consumer care. The elaborate investment in education and care imagined by the Star Industries court is substantial; it seems doubtful that anyone, other than the most motivated ( and ? unhurried?) consumer, would exercise the degree of care hypothesized by the court. 204 But, at a minimum, the model indicates that opportunity alone is an insufficient basis for a finding of high levels of consumer care or sophistication. The courts‘ assumptions about interactions with sales personnel are similarly flawed. It may well be that a consumer who is sufficiently motivated in the purchase of lawn and garden equipment or perfume will exercise even 202 Lever Bros. v. Am. Bakeries Co., 537 F. Supp. 248, 255 ( E. D. N. Y. 1982) ( concluding that ? the ordinary purchaser of AUTUMN margarine and AUTUMN GRAIN bread is a casual, unsophisticated buyer,? and also explaining that an atmosphere ? in which over 5,000 trademarked items are presented? is unlikely to be conducive to a high level of consumer care). 203 Star Industries, 412 F. 3d at 390. 204 Id. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 615 more care where the ? opportunity? for such cognition is facilitated by trained personnel who can be expected to ? help[] inform customers of the differences in the products.? 205 But it cannot reliably be said that such opportunity alone ensures high levels of care. The threshold question is whether there is sufficient motivation for consumers to exercise care. For lawn and garden equipment that presents little or no risk ( e. g., an inexpensive pair of work gloves), no amount of opportunity will ensure a high degree of consumer care. b. Compelled “ Opportunity” ( and Increased Capacity) On the other hand, the courts are on stronger theoretical footing in cases where the purchase process requires extended interaction with sales personnel in an inherently complex purchase. In cases involving complex financial instruments or healthcare plans, for example, the consumer behavior model arguably provides some support for the judicial inference of a high degree of consumer care. The reason is that, in those circumstances, the consumer can be presumed to have sufficient motivation ( if she proceeds through a complex or multi- step process requiring the exertion of cognition), and the extended opportunity for involvement can only add to the degree of care exercised by the consumer. In other words, where the transaction can proceed only if the consumer proceeds through a complex, multi- step purchase process, we can assume that all consumers who endure this process have sufficient motivation. Since they are sufficiently motivated, the extended opportunity— of frequent exposure over a long period of time— increases the likelihood of exercising a high degree of consumer care. 206 A complex, multi- step purchase process may also enhance a consumer‘ s ? capability? to exercise consumer care. Consumers who have had repeated opportunities to encounter relevant market information will develop more active knowledge structures that will facilitate more efficient and more effective judgment. 207 Thus, the multi- step purchase process indicates a high 205 Frances Rothschild v. U. S. Cosmetic Fragrance Mktg. Corp., 223 U. S. P. Q. 817, 818 ( N. D. Tex. 1983). 206 We are a little less sanguine about the blithe judicial assertion that sales personnel can always be expected to ? help[] inform customers? in their performance of the source- identification judgment. Id. Some sales personnel may facilitate source- identification in some circumstances, but that will not always be the case. In some circumstances, the salesperson‘ s motivation will be very different from the consumer‘ s; the former may sometimes give in to the perverse incentive to thwart source identification if that is what it takes to convince the consumer to make the purchase. 207 See supra text accompanying notes 136– 37. 616 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 level of consumer care across several levels of the model: motivation is assumed, while opportunity is required. 208 A similar approach may be the key to understanding a conflict in the case law over the question of whether the ? wine buying public? is ? a highly discriminating group? 209 or a collection of ? generally unsophisticated = impulse‘ buyers who are an = easy mark for a [ trademark] infringer.‘? 210 In criticizing the former conclusion ( adopted in 1959 by a federal district court in Alabama), the latter court relied on expert testimony to conclude that ? the average American consumer is unlearned in the selection of wine.? 211 The difference in the courts‘ assessments of the degree of consumer sophistication, however, seems to have more to do with differences in opportunity than with any difference in available evidence of capability. In the Alabama case, there was evidence before the court that state law effectively compelled an extended opportunity to exercise consumer care. 212 Specifically, as the court explained: The evidence reflects that practically all of the wine in the State of Alabama is sold through state owned and operated liquor stores. The law requires that the prospective purchaser select from display counters the product he desires, and after making that selection he is required to request that product of the salesman by name. After paying the cashier for the product, it is produced by the salesman for the purchaser‘ s inspection prior to the time it is packaged. Thus, in the State of Alabama it is virtually impossible for a wine purchaser to be confused by similar trademarks. 213 This is compelled ? opportunity.? The Alabama wine buyer was effectively required to exercise consumer care through a multi- step exchange with a salesman that involved a request and confirmation of the product name. Such a consumer can be presumed to possess at least enough motivation to complete these steps in order to make the purchase. Thus, and for this reason, the Alabama wine- buying public in 1959 was to some degree a ? discriminating 208 We hasten to add two important caveats. First, as explained above, in some circumstances, the steps in a complex purchase process may actually interfere with the source- identification judgment. If sales personnel are motivated to complete the sale, irrespective of any concern about consumer confusion, they may— consciously or unconsciously— shed more noise than light on the source- identification judgment. Second, and as elaborated below, compelled care will never be the same as care spurred on by a consumer‘ s native involvement. See infra text accompanying note 212. 209 E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Ben R. Goltsman & Co., 172 F. Supp. 826, 830 n. 2 ( M. D. Ala. 1959). 210 E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Consorzio del Gallo Nero, 782 F. Supp. 457, 465 ( N. D. Cal. 1991). 211 Id. 212 See Ben R. Goltsman & Co., 172 F. Supp. at 830 n. 3. 213 Id. 2008] TRADEMARKS & CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY 617 group,? even if the discrimination was not the result of any situational or enduring involvement. Our model gives ample reason to doubt the court‘ s bolder assertion, however, that it would be ? virtually impossible? for such a wine purchaser to be confused. 214 We see no reason to expect that consumers compelled to engage in an extended purchase process would exercise the degree of care necessary to distinguish between two facially identical trademarks. Indeed, compelled care is an imperfect substitute for care triggered by perceived risk or enduring involvement. A consumer who is compelled to go through the motions of a purchase process will be more likely to just ? go through the motions.? Thus, although a consumer compelled to participate in extended opportunities for care may be somewhat more careful than one who is not, the compelled consumer is not the equivalent of the consumer whose care is spurred by her own perceptions of risk or her native enduring involvement. c. Reduced Opportunity Finally, if opportunity is conceived of as a necessary prerequisite to consumer care, the consumer behavior model also provides theoretical support for a finding of relatively low levels of consumer care in purchasing environments that reduce opportunities for care. The ? infomercial? case cited above arguably fits in here. 215 To the extent an infomercial requires a hurried, impulsive purchase, a low level of consumer care is indicated despite whatever risk factors might otherwise cue motivation for extended involvement. Similarly, if the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of the typical supermarket? makes it impossible for consumers to engage in careful transactions, 216 then consumer care is untenable. Our model suggests good reasons to be skeptical of such a finding, however. Even in the ? bustling, self- service atmosphere of the typical supermarket,? we might expect a consumer faced with sufficient financial risk— such as in the purchase of a relatively expensive product— to be sufficiently motivated that she might overcome the cacophony of the purchase situation and exercise a relatively high degree of care. Where motivation is 214 Id. 215 See supra note 186 and accompanying text ( discussing Telebrands Corp. v. E. Mishan & Sons, 46 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1493, 1508 ( S. D. N. Y. 1997)). 216 Lever Bros. v. Am. Bakeries Co., 537 F. Supp. 248, 255 ( E. D. N. Y. 1982). 618 EMORY LAW JOURNAL [ Vol. 57 high, only the most severe situational constraints on opportunity may effectively foreclose the exercise of consumer care. Thus, a refinement of the ? necessary condition? formulation may be in order: An adequate opportunity is a necessary condition for the exercise of consumer care, but the adequacy of the opportunity will necessarily vary in relation to the level of consumer motivation.

                "title": "Guide to the Leonard J. Arrington Papers, 1839-1999",
                "description": "This collection consists of 13 different series which reflect his personal life, his professional career, and his research interests he conducted while a professor at Utah State University and Brigham Young University.; Biographical Note; Upon his death in February 1999, Leonard J. Arrington left behind a legacy of scholarship and mentoring that rightly earned him the title \"Dean of Mormon History.\" Largely because of his leadership, Mormon historical studies in the second half of the twentieth century became a viable subject in the larger discipline of American history. His book Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints is still considered to be one of the classic works of Mormon history. Due to his prominent place in Mormon studies, Arrington's papers are a valuable source of information for anyone interested in Mormon history in general, but especially for those interested in the growth of the field in the twentieth century.; Leonard Arrington was born on July 2, 1917, in Twin Falls, Idaho, the second child of Noah and Edna Arrington, two devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (more commonly known as Mormons). Growing up on a chicken farm, Leonard first entertained thoughts of becoming a farmer himself. This desire was enhanced through his participation in the Future Farmers of America, where he served in both state and national positions. When the time for college came, Arrington chose the University of Idaho, where he had attended an FFA convention, hoping to major in agriculture. The chemistry requirements, however, soon led Arrington to change his mind and he concentrated instead on agricultural economics.; After graduating from the University of Idaho, Arrington continued his education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he began studies towards a doctorate in economics and began teaching classes with the aid of a Kenan Teaching Fellowship. World War II interrupted his schooling, and Arrington served overseas for the United States in both North Africa and Italy from 1943 to 1946, working first in a prisoner-of-war processing division and later performing tasks for Italy's Institute of Statistics. These years were especially difficult for Arrington since he had to be away from his wife, Grace Fort, whom he had married in the fall of 1942. Following the war, Arrington returned to the United States, where he began working as an economics professor at Utah State Agricultural College (later Utah State University) in Logan in 1946. Returning in subsequent years to the University of North Carolina to complete course work and necessary exams, he finally received his doctorate in economics in March 1952. His dissertation was entitled \"Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847-1900.\" This topic led Arrington to begin studying a wide variety of issues pertaining to Mormon economic history. Following the publication of his first scholarly articles on this subject in 1951, Arrington began slowly to transform himself from an economist to a historian.; Arrington found his work at Utah State University to be very satisfying. Later in his life he would reminisce about how much he loved his years in Cache Valley and how much he enjoyed teaching and mentoring students. Arrington's professional reputation rapidly grew from his numerous articles and lectures, and in 1958 Harvard University Press published a work based on his dissertation entitled Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints. The book soon became a Western American history classic, but because the press published it on the recommendation of the Committee on Research in Economic History, Arrington received no royalties from the book until 1993, when the University of Utah Press released a second edition.; During his tenure at Utah State University in the 1950s Arrington enjoyed the company of several other budding Mormon scholars, including S. George Ellsworth, a professor of history, and Eugene E. Campbell, a staff member at the LDS Church Institute in Logan. Arrington's family grew during this time with the birth of three children: James Wesley in 1948, Carl Wayne in 1951, and Susan Grace in 1954. Arrington also participated in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in numerous leadership capacities, including second counselor in the Utah State University Stake Presidency.; From 1958 to 1959 he momentarily interrupted his Logan stay by taking his family to Italy as a Fulbright Professor of American Economics at the University of Genoa. In 1966, he again left Logan to serve as visiting professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, for the 1966-1967 academic school year.; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Arrington participated in several important professional endeavors, including the establishment of the Mormon History Association (serving as its first president) and the creation of the Western Historical Quarterly, the premier academic journal of the American West. He also served as president of the Western History Association, the Agricultural History Association, and the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association. Finally, in 1972, he became Church Historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, simultaneously receiving an appointment as Lemuel H. Redd Professor of Western History and Director of the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies at Brigham Young University.; Arrington worked as Church Historian from 1972 to 1982, when the church transferred his division to Brigham Young University, renaming it the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. As the first (and only) professional academic to be named Church Historian, Arrington presided over a blossoming of Mormon history. His colleagues produced numerous important historical studies, and Arrington himself authored or co-authored several books, including David Eccles: Pioneer Western Industrialist (1975); Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation Among the Mormons (1976); The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints (1979); and Brigham Young: American Moses (1985).; At the same time, Arrington experienced numerous personal and professional frustrations, as he constantly combated a church hierarchy which did not regard the work of his department as \"faith-promoting.\" Balancing his commitment to his profession and his loyalty to his church, Arrington frequently clashed with church authorities. Finally, the Church appointed G. Homer Durham as managing director of the division, and Durham worked constantly to ensure that the department produced \"faith-promoting\" history. This approach ultimately led to Arrington's release as Church Historian, Durham's appointment to that position, and the transfer of the entire Historical Department to Brigham Young University in 1982.; Arrington also battled a personal tragedy during this time. In March 1982, Grace, his wife of nearly forty years, succumbed to heart disease and passed away. Both personally and professionally bereft, Arrington turned to his role as educator and found solace in his classes at Brigham Young University. He also met and began dating Harriet Horne in 1983. After a quick courtship, the two were married on November 19, 1983. Harriet provided not only welcome companionship, but also aided Arrington's research and writing by entering drafts of his books on her computer and collaborating with him on occasion. As a result, Arrington remained a productive scholar throughout the 1980s and 1990s, publishing numerous works such as the commissioned two-volume History of Idaho, a memoir of his years as Church Historian, a biography of Utah rancher Charlie Redd, and biographies of Harold and Madelyn Silver. He also co-authored two books with his daughter, Susan Arrington Madsen, and collaborated on several projects with his step-daughter, Heidi Swinton. In addition, he continued to mentor numerous scholars in Mormon history by critiquing their manuscripts, write letters of recommendation, and provide encouraging words about their endeavors.; As Arrington grew older, he could look back on the numerous awards and honors he received for his prolific work. In 1962 he presented a well-received paper on the Topaz World War II Relocation Camp for Japanese-Americans as part of Utah State University's Faculty Honor Lecture series. In 1969 he received the David O. McKay Humanities Award from Brigham Young University. In 1986 he became the first Mormon and the first Utahn to be elected a member of the Society of American Historians, one of the highest honors bestowed upon American historians. Finally, in 1996 he was presented with the Governor's Award in the Humanities in Utah.; Arrington has also received numerous accolades for his writings. Great Basin Kingdom received the Award of Merit of the American Association of State and Local History and was also given the annual award of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association for the best first book by a Western historian in 1958-1959. It became the first book on the Mountain West placed in the White House's presidential library. Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation Among the Mormons, co-authored with Dean May and Feramorz Y. Fox, received the Best Book Award for 1976 from the Mormon History Association, while Brigham Young: American Moses was the first recipient of the David W. and Beatrice Cannon Evans Award for a distinguished biography of a significant personality living in Mormon country during the past 150 years. It also won the Mormon History Association Best Book Award for 1985 and was nominated by the National Book Critics Circle as a distinguished work of biography.; The Leonard J. Arrington Papers are divided into 13 different series which reflect his personal life, his professional career, and his research interests. The first five series deal with his professional life, both as an educator and as Church Historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1972 to 1982. The first series consists of his teaching files and the research projects he conducted while a professor at Utah State University and Brigham Young University. The next two series deal specifically with his tenure as Church Historian, with one series containing his correspondence as Church Historian and the other documenting the work conducted by his staff and himself. The fourth series consists of records of his affiliations with professional organizations such as the Mormon History Association, the Utah State Historical Society, the Western History Association, and others. This series contains newsletters from the associations, correspondence with members, and documents concerning events such as the founding of the Mormon History Association and the establishment of the Western Historical Quarterly. The fifth series contains correspondence with and files about scholars, associates, and colleagues.; The next four series document Arrington's research interests. One series contains his files on women's history; another his research on Utah history; a third his work on the Great Depression and the New Deal; and a fourth his research files in Mormon history. This last group is especially important, as it contains both primary documents and secondary material. The primary documents consist of such items as minutes of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young's letter books, and diaries and journals from high church leaders such as Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and from everyday saints such as Richard Roskelley. The secondary material consists of extensive research files on a variety of topics, including the LDS Church and African Americans; the Equal Rights Amendment and the Mormons in the 1970s; and LDS Church Presidents, as well as biographies of numerous Mormons, files on authors who wrote about Mormonism, research on the Mormon Church's business enterprises, and drafts of articles, books, dissertations, and theses on Mormonism. This series ends with Arrington's extensive newspaper clippings on the LDS Church from the 1940s to 1997.; The next two series illuminate Arrington's personal life. Series ten consists of his personal papers, including correspondence, New Year's Resolutions, speeches given in junior high school and high school, drafts of autobiographies and memoirs, scrapbooks, documents about his military service, his files of newspaper and magazine clippings, his exams from the University of Idaho, his class notes from the University of North Carolina, and his extensive diary which runs from the 1930s to 1998. Series eleven consists of his family papers, including information about his wives, children, parents, and brothers and sisters, as well as his family history.; The last series in the Arrington collection consists of his writings. This contains drafts and notes of almost all of Arrington's writings, including Great Basin Kingdom (1958); a history of First Security Bank (1973); Beet Sugar in the West: A History of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company (1966); The Mormon Experience (1979); Brigham Young: American Moses (1985); History of Idaho (1994); Adventures of a Church Historian (1998); and an unpublished biography of W.W. Clyde. The collection also holds over one hundred articles and speeches that Arrington wrote or gave.; The materials in Series 13 were donated to USU Special Collections in 2006 by Harriet Arrington, the widow of Leonard J. Arrington. This thirty-one box addendum consists of Leonard J. Arrington's working files and contains his correspondence, research papers, speeches, and other similar materials. These papers span the period of 1938 to 2004 with the bulk spanning 1965 to 1997. The correspondence in this Series concerns Arrington's dialogue with various Mormon history scholars, his work as Church Historian, and with various organizations. Box 31 contains research papers used to formulate The Mormon Experience and were complied and donated to USU Special Collections in 2003 by Richard Daines.; Because of Arrington's prolific career, the Leonard J. Arrington Papers provides an abundance of material about Mormon history and the history of the American West. In general it is an important resource for scholars interested in Mormon history topics. Perhaps the primary importance of the collection, however, is its documentation of the Mormon history field in the late twentieth century, a time when the discipline truly came into its own. Fifty years from now, scholars will be able to piece together why such an abundance of scholarly Mormon history was produced during this era, in large part because of the records and documents that Arrington left behind. His Church History Division files, his drafts of his own writings, his personal papers, and his files on his professional affiliations all help to tell the story of Mormon historiography. Whether one is interested in Mormon history in general, or merely in the life of one of the most prolific and outstanding scholars of American history, Leonard J. Arrington's papers provide an abundance of information.; In addition to this manuscript collection, a separate photograph collection has been created containing photographs that were donated with Arrington's papers. For preservation purposes, all intact newspapers have also been removed from this collection and replaced with a reference note.; 13 series form the Leonard J.

                            "description": "This collection consists of 13 different series which reflect his personal life, his professional career, and his research interests he conducted while a professor at Utah State University and Brigham Young University.; Biographical Note; Upon his death in February 1999, Leonard J. Arrington left behind a legacy of scholarship and mentoring that rightly earned him the title \"Dean of Mormon History.\" Largely because of his leadership, Mormon historical studies in the second half of the twentieth century became a viable subject in the larger discipline of American history. His book Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints is still considered to be one of the classic works of Mormon history. Due to his prominent place in Mormon studies, Arrington's papers are a valuable source of information for anyone interested in Mormon history in general, but especially for those interested in the growth of the field in the twentieth century.; Leonard Arrington was born on July 2, 1917, in Twin Falls, Idaho, the second child of Noah and Edna Arrington, two devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (more commonly known as Mormons). Growing up on a chicken farm, Leonard first entertained thoughts of becoming a farmer himself. This desire was enhanced through his participation in the Future Farmers of America, where he served in both state and national positions. When the time for college came, Arrington chose the University of Idaho, where he had attended an FFA convention, hoping to major in agriculture. The chemistry requirements, however, soon led Arrington to change his mind and he concentrated instead on agricultural economics.; After graduating from the University of Idaho, Arrington continued his education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he began studies towards a doctorate in economics and began teaching classes with the aid of a Kenan Teaching Fellowship. World War II interrupted his schooling, and Arrington served overseas for the United States in both North Africa and Italy from 1943 to 1946, working first in a prisoner-of-war processing division and later performing tasks for Italy's Institute of Statistics. These years were especially difficult for Arrington since he had to be away from his wife, Grace Fort, whom he had married in the fall of 1942. Following the war, Arrington returned to the United States, where he began working as an economics professor at Utah State Agricultural College (later Utah State University) in Logan in 1946. Returning in subsequent years to the University of North Carolina to complete course work and necessary exams, he finally received his doctorate in economics in March 1952. His dissertation was entitled \"Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847-1900.\" This topic led Arrington to begin studying a wide variety of issues pertaining to Mormon economic history. Following the publication of his first scholarly articles on this subject in 1951, Arrington began slowly to transform himself from an economist to a historian.; Arrington found his work at Utah State University to be very satisfying. Later in his life he would reminisce about how much he loved his years in Cache Valley and how much he enjoyed teaching and mentoring students. Arrington's professional reputation rapidly grew from his numerous articles and lectures, and in 1958 Harvard University Press published a work based on his dissertation entitled Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints. The book soon became a Western American history classic, but because the press published it on the recommendation of the Committee on Research in Economic History, Arrington received no royalties from the book until 1993, when the University of Utah Press released a second edition.; During his tenure at Utah State University in the 1950s Arrington enjoyed the company of several other budding Mormon scholars, including S. George Ellsworth, a professor of history, and Eugene E. Campbell, a staff member at the LDS Church Institute in Logan. Arrington's family grew during this time with the birth of three children: James Wesley in 1948, Carl Wayne in 1951, and Susan Grace in 1954. Arrington also participated in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in numerous leadership capacities, including second counselor in the Utah State University Stake Presidency.; From 1958 to 1959 he momentarily interrupted his Logan stay by taking his family to Italy as a Fulbright Professor of American Economics at the University of Genoa. In 1966, he again left Logan to serve as visiting professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, for the 1966-1967 academic school year.; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Arrington participated in several important professional endeavors, including the establishment of the Mormon History Association (serving as its first president) and the creation of the Western Historical Quarterly, the premier academic journal of the American West. He also served as president of the Western History Association, the Agricultural History Association, and the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association. Finally, in 1972, he became Church Historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, simultaneously receiving an appointment as Lemuel H. Redd Professor of Western History and Director of the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies at Brigham Young University.; Arrington worked as Church Historian from 1972 to 1982, when the church transferred his division to Brigham Young University, renaming it the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. As the first (and only) professional academic to be named Church Historian, Arrington presided over a blossoming of Mormon history. His colleagues produced numerous important historical studies, and Arrington himself authored or co-authored several books, including David Eccles: Pioneer Western Industrialist (1975); Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation Among the Mormons (1976); The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints (1979); and Brigham Young: American Moses (1985).; At the same time, Arrington experienced numerous personal and professional frustrations, as he constantly combated a church hierarchy which did not regard the work of his department as \"faith-promoting.\" Balancing his commitment to his profession and his loyalty to his church, Arrington frequently clashed with church authorities. Finally, the Church appointed G. Homer Durham as managing director of the division, and Durham worked constantly to ensure that the department produced \"faith-promoting\" history. This approach ultimately led to Arrington's release as Church Historian, Durham's appointment to that position, and the transfer of the entire Historical Department to Brigham Young University in 1982.; Arrington also battled a personal tragedy during this time. In March 1982, Grace, his wife of nearly forty years, succumbed to heart disease and passed away. Both personally and professionally bereft, Arrington turned to his role as educator and found solace in his classes at Brigham Young University. He also met and began dating Harriet Horne in 1983. After a quick courtship, the two were married on November 19, 1983. Harriet provided not only welcome companionship, but also aided Arrington's research and writing by entering drafts of his books on her computer and collaborating with him on occasion. As a result, Arrington remained a productive scholar throughout the 1980s and 1990s, publishing numerous works such as the commissioned two-volume History of Idaho, a memoir of his years as Church Historian, a biography of Utah rancher Charlie Redd, and biographies of Harold and Madelyn Silver. He also co-authored two books with his daughter, Susan Arrington Madsen, and collaborated on several projects with his step-daughter, Heidi Swinton. In addition, he continued to mentor numerous scholars in Mormon history by critiquing their manuscripts, write letters of recommendation, and provide encouraging words about their endeavors.; As Arrington grew older, he could look back on the numerous awards and honors he received for his prolific work. In 1962 he presented a well-received paper on the Topaz World War II Relocation Camp for Japanese-Americans as part of Utah State University's Faculty Honor Lecture series. In 1969 he received the David O. McKay Humanities Award from Brigham Young University. In 1986 he became the first Mormon and the first Utahn to be elected a member of the Society of American Historians, one of the highest honors bestowed upon American historians. Finally, in 1996 he was presented with the Governor's Award in the Humanities in Utah.; Arrington has also received numerous accolades for his writings. Great Basin Kingdom received the Award of Merit of the American Association of State and Local History and was also given the annual award of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association for the best first book by a Western historian in 1958-1959. It became the first book on the Mountain West placed in the White House's presidential library. Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation Among the Mormons, co-authored with Dean May and Feramorz Y. Fox, received the Best Book Award for 1976 from the Mormon History Association, while Brigham Young: American Moses was the first recipient of the David W. and Beatrice Cannon Evans Award for a distinguished biography of a significant personality living in Mormon country during the past 150 years. It also won the Mormon History Association Best Book Award for 1985 and was nominated by the National Book Critics Circle as a distinguished work of biography.; The Leonard J. Arrington Papers are divided into 13 different series which reflect his personal life, his professional career, and his research interests. The first five series deal with his professional life, both as an educator and as Church Historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1972 to 1982. The first series consists of his teaching files and the research projects he conducted while a professor at Utah State University and Brigham Young University. The next two series deal specifically with his tenure as Church Historian, with one series containing his correspondence as Church Historian and the other documenting the work conducted by his staff and himself. The fourth series consists of records of his affiliations with professional organizations such as the Mormon History Association, the Utah State Historical Society, the Western History Association, and others. This series contains newsletters from the associations, correspondence with members, and documents concerning events such as the founding of the Mormon History Association and the establishment of the Western Historical Quarterly. The fifth series contains correspondence with and files about scholars, associates, and colleagues.; The next four series document Arrington's research interests. One series contains his files on women's history; another his research on Utah history; a third his work on the Great Depression and the New Deal; and a fourth his research files in Mormon history. This last group is especially important, as it contains both primary documents and secondary material. The primary documents consist of such items as minutes of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young's letter books, and diaries and journals from high church leaders such as Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards and from everyday saints such as Richard Roskelley. The secondary material consists of extensive research files on a variety of topics, including the LDS Church and African Americans; the Equal Rights Amendment and the Mormons in the 1970s; and LDS Church Presidents, as well as biographies of numerous Mormons, files on authors who wrote about Mormonism, research on the Mormon Church's business enterprises, and drafts of articles, books, dissertations, and theses on Mormonism. This series ends with Arrington's extensive newspaper clippings on the LDS Church from the 1940s to 1997.; The next two series illuminate Arrington's personal life. Series ten consists of his personal papers, including correspondence, New Year's Resolutions, speeches given in junior high school and high school, drafts of autobiographies and memoirs, scrapbooks, documents about his military service, his files of newspaper and magazine clippings, his exams from the University of Idaho, his class notes from the University of North Carolina, and his extensive diary which runs from the 1930s to 1998. Series eleven consists of his family papers, including information about his wives, children, parents, and brothers and sisters, as well as his family history.; The last series in the Arrington collection consists of his writings. This contains drafts and notes of almost all of Arrington's writings, including Great Basin Kingdom (1958); a history of First Security Bank (1973); Beet Sugar in the West: A History of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company (1966); The Mormon Experience (1979); Brigham Young: American Moses (1985); History of Idaho (1994); Adventures of a Church Historian (1998); and an unpublished biography of W.W. Clyde. The collection also holds over one hundred articles and speeches that Arrington wrote or gave.; The materials in Series 13 were donated to USU Special Collections in 2006 by Harriet Arrington, the widow of Leonard J. Arrington. This thirty-one box addendum consists of Leonard J. Arrington's working files and contains his correspondence, research papers, speeches, and other similar materials. These papers span the period of 1938 to 2004 with the bulk spanning 1965 to 1997. The correspondence in this Series concerns Arrington's dialogue with various Mormon history scholars, his work as Church Historian, and with various organizations. Box 31 contains research papers used to formulate The Mormon Experience and were complied and donated to USU Special Collections in 2003 by Richard Daines.; Because of Arrington's prolific career, the Leonard J. Arrington Papers provides an abundance of material about Mormon history and the history of the American West. In general it is an important resource for scholars interested in Mormon history topics. Perhaps the primary importance of the collection, however, is its documentation of the Mormon history field in the late twentieth century, a time when the discipline truly came into its own. Fifty years from now, scholars will be able to piece together why such an abundance of scholarly Mormon history was produced during this era, in large part because of the records and documents that Arrington left behind. His Church History Division files, his drafts of his own writings, his personal papers, and his files on his professional affiliations all help to tell the story of Mormon historiography. Whether one is interested in Mormon history in general, or merely in the life of one of the most prolific and outstanding scholars of American history, Leonard J. Arrington's papers provide an abundance of information.; In addition to this manuscript collection, a separate photograph collection has been created containing photographs that were donated with Arrington's papers. For preservation purposes, all intact newspapers have also been removed from this collection and replaced with a reference note.; 13 series form the Leonard J. Arrington papers: Series 1: Teaching (27 boxes) Series 2: LDS Church Historical Department: Correspondence (19 boxes)Series 3: LDS Church Historical Department: Files (19 boxes)Series 4: Professional Affiliations (40 boxes)Series 5: Colleagues (23 boxes)Series 6: Women's History (11 boxes)Series 7: Utah History (58 boxes)Series 8: The Great Depression and the New Deal (7 boxes)Series 9: Mormon History Topics (175 boxes)Series 10: Personal Papers (101 boxes)Series 11: Family Papers (9 boxes)Series 12: Writings of Leonard J.

We are grateful for the opportunity to gain \"hands on\" experience in marketing research. We are pleased to provide you with this hard bound report containing the objectives, methodology, findings, conclusions, and recommendations of our study for Chuck-ARama's Provo and Orem restaurants. We hope that the information herein will provide you with a base to make future marketing decisions for Chuck-A-Rama. Sincerely, Big West Marketing Aaron Cobabe Brendan Snow Betty Ward Scott Hales Executive Summary EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Chuck-A-Rama is a buffet-style restaurant offering a large selection of food including a salad bar, a dessert bar, and a hot food bar containing several entrees. Chuck-A-Rama's corporate headquarters is located in Salt Lake City with restaurants in Provo, Orem, Salt Lake City, and Ogden. Chuck-A-Rama's Executive Vice-President, Mike Johanson, has asked Big West Marketing to conduct a marketing research project for the Provo and Orem Chuck-ARama restaurants. The purpose of this study is to provide Chuck-A-Rama information on Provo/Orem area residents perception of Chuck-A-Rama and of buffet style restaurants in general. Also, the project includes findings on how effective Chuck-a-Rama's advertising has been in reaching potential customers. RESEARCH QUESTIONS What is the public's attitude towards buffet-style restaurants in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service? What is the public's perception of Chuck-A-Rama in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service and how does it compare to other restaurants in the Provo/Orem area (including Sizzler and Ponderosa)? What types of media have been most effective in increasing community patronage of Chuck-A-Rama? METHODOLOGY Two focus groups were conducted to determine specific perceptions about Chuck-A-Rama in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service. From the information discussed in the focus groups, a telephone questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was randomly administered to 300 respondents. Exploratory and secondary research was conducted; however, the information gathered was inappropriate for application to the Chuck-A-Rama study. Executive Summary CONCLUSIONS Chuck-A-Rama is the best overall value when compared to Sizzler and Ponderosa. The majority of restaurant customers in Provo and Orem frequent foreign food restaurants. Quality of Food and Service are the most important attributes in selecting a restaurant. Nearly half of those people surveyed had not seen any type of advertising for Chuck-A-Rama. Lack of quality food and good service are the main reasons people do not like buffet-style restaurants. Executive Summary RECOMMENDATIONS Use television advertisements for awareness and promotions Create menu awareness Provide hostesses to direct customers in \"proper procedures\" Tipping Make Chuck-A-Rama affordable for families Create a Salad bar only option Control noise levels Create a private area for banquets and conferences Limitations LIMITATIONS Big West Marketing carefully followed the proposed methodology in order to gather data with as little error as possible. However, some unavoidable limitations do exist. The following paragraphs outline these possible errors. Sampling Error The telephone survey was gathered through a representative sampling of Provo/Orem area residents. The survey was administered to 291 people from which inferences are made to the entire population. Because this was a survey and not a census, some sampling error does exist. Response Error After completing the survey and analyzing the data, the research team found that some respondents answers appeared to give inaccurate information. There are several reasons that respondents give erroneous information. They include the following reasons: Respondents do not take the study seriously Respondents want to impress the interviewers Respondents are embarrassed, or do not want to respond Respondents do not understand the questions Respondents do not know, remember, or communicate requested information (Andrus, 103) Non-Response Error Although 291 people responded to the questionnaire, some people chose not to respond to certain questions. For example, several respondents felt uncomfortable giving their ages and income levels. Because of this factor, some questions will have fewer than 291 responses. Limitations Measurement Error Measurement errors exist when questions asked to respondents are ambiguous or the sequence of the questions influences the respondents answers. Also, interviewers can make mistakes by not following questionnaire instructions, inappropriately influencing respondents, or misrecording data.

APPENDIX A: PROPOSAL APPENDIX B: QUESTIONNAIRE APPENDIX C: FREQUENCIES APPENDIX D: CROSS TABS DETAILED FINDINGS Foeus Groups FOCUS GROUPS Focus groups are small groups of people who are brought together in a comfortable setting to informally discuss a research subject, under the guidance of a moderator. Focus groups use interaction to stimulate responses. They provide insights which are not possible with questionnaires. (Andrus, 139) Big West Marketing conducted two separate focus groups each consisting of five married couples. Six people were sent to the Provo restaurant and six were sent to the Orem restaurant. The participants had one week to attend Chuck-A-Rama with their spouses, and at the end of the week, all attended a focus group meeting with Big West Marketing. The two focus groups were held in the Tanner Building on BYV campus. The entire meeting was videod by Big West Marketing. Major Issues The major problems focus group participants discussed include the following: 1. No apparent signs or indications of clear procedures for the customer to follow 2. Poor labeling of foods and salad bar dressings 3. Lack of an exclusive salad bar offer 4. Pricing high for a large family with lots of kids Instructions Many of the participants felt they needed better instructions on how to \"eat\" at Chu,ck-A-Rama. For example, they didn't know whether to seat themselves or be seated. They wondered if they should get their own drink, Foeus Groups or wait for a waiter/waitress to bring it to them. Should the customer get a new plate each time he/she goes back for more food? Are tips appropriate? And if so, for the service rendered, what tips are expected? And, how does one know that a table is already taken? All these honest questions may encourage Chuck-A-Rama to reevaluate its signing and instructions given to the customer. Labeling The focus groups came to a consensus that some of the items like salad dressing need to be marked (or if marked, marked more clearly) to help the customer know what is what. Salad Bar Several of the focus group participants expressed a positive perception of Chuck-A-Rama's salad bar. They wish that Chuck-A-Rama would offer some kind of a \"salad bar option\", in which they could eat exclusively from the salad bar at a lower cost. Pricing Many of the participants who have large families expressed a concern about the pricing of Chuck-A-Rama. They said that it is just too expensive to take the whole family to Chuck-A-Rama, especially when the small kids eat so little. Other Issues Many comments were made by individuals in the focus groups. The following were individual perceptions, ideas, frustrations, and opinions expressed to Big West Marketing: 2 FDeus Groups Negative Price might be a little high for younger families. Give customers a menu so they know what food is being served. Parking lot in Orem is always full - hard to find a place to park. Difficult to access the Orem restaurant. Hard to cross the street. Have a night for families - special prices. Better prices for children $3.00 too much for a 6 year old Wanted more breads. Ice Cream tasted like powdered milk. Didn't like the chicken. Desserts all tasted the same. Some of the dishes were dirty and spotted. Not much recognition of advertising. Provide a box of gloves for handling the serving spoon. Didn't like Using the same spoon someone else used. Didn't know what to do when they got there. Did not like the name Chuck-A-Rama. Their impressions were: 1. Reminded them of wagon wheels. Give a bad image. 2. Everything seems to have the name ARAMA. 3. you just go there to stuff yourself. 4. Dark, Brown, and Orange restaurant that has poor food. One person would not return because he didn't want to have all you can eat. He didn't believe that you should stuff yourself. Very well decorated with light colors. Several loved the salad bar and would go just for the salad if they didn't have to pay $7.00 just for a salad. Offer just salad for a lower price. Price seemed good. Liked Chuck-A-Rama more than the competition. Never treated bad at Chuck-A-Rama. They wouldn't return if service was bad. Dessert bar very popular to families with children. Good service. Liked deserts in small servings. Well done. S year old loves all you can eat desserts. 3 FDeus Groups Positive ....., Food stayed fresh and hot because it was usedi. Fruit bar was very good. A lot of good vegetables. Bathrooms were clean and family oriented with changing tables. Restaurant has a happy light atmosphere. Clean restrooms. Very nice displays Salad bar was very nice looking and bright, seemed to stand out. Liked food on different bars or serving areas. Very good muffins. Provo restaurant more light and open than the Orem restaurant. 5 Detailed Findings DETAILED FINDINGS Question 1: What restaurant do you visit most often? At the beginning of the survey, the respondents were introduced to the survey with a question about which restaurant they frequent most often. The individual restaurants were classified into the following categories: Fast Food: Foreign Food: Western Food: Sizzler Ponderosa Chuck-A-Rama Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, etc. Olive Garden, Los Hermanos, China Bowl, etc. Prestwich Farms, Tony Romas, Magelbys, etc. Eleven percent of the respondents' said that Chuck-A-Rama was the restaurant they visited most often. Sizzler and Ponderosa scored considerably lower with 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively. (See following graph \"Which Restaurant do you visit most often\") Foreign foods was ranked highest I Question 2 and Question 3: Do you like buffet-style restaurants and why? Approximately seventy-five percent of the respondents said they like buffet-style restaurants and fifty percent of those liked buffets because of the variety of food. Low quality of food was the main reason 25% percent of the respondents did not like buffet-style restaurants. (See following three graphs \"Do you like buffets, why like buffets, why dislike buffets) 5 Detailed Fina Question 4: Thi i a filter question designed to allow only those pe with recent experiences at buffet-style restaurants to COID] the entire questionnaire. Question 5 through 8: These questions were asked to determine the ov importance of price, quality of food, atmosphere, and selVi, cu tomers selection of a restaurant. All the attributes v, from omewhat to very important to most customers, hOWl eventy percent of the respondents said that quality of food VERY important. (See following graph \"How important 2 6 Detailed Findings Questions 11, 18, 25: These questions compared Sizzler, Ponderosa, and Chuck-A-Rama in terms of price. Chuck-A-Rama was stronger than the other two restaurants in this area. Thirty-six percent of the respondents rated Chuck-A-Rama excellent in tenns of price. Ponderosa was rated excellent in tenns of price by 14% of the respondents. Only twelve percent of the respondents rated Sizzler excellent in price. Sizzler's highest rating in terms of price was in the fair category with 39% of the respondents. (See following graph \"Price\") Questions 12, 19, 26: The quality of food was discussed in these questions. Again, Chuck-A-Rama received the highest rating in terms of quality of food with 36% of the respondents listing them as excellent. Sizzler was extremely close with 35% of the respondents listing them as excellent in tenns of quality of food. Ponderosa received an excellent rating from only 10% of the respondents. (See following graph \"Quality\") 7 Detailed Fin. Questions 13, 20, 27: The next attribute, service, was ra comparatively high in the respondents selection of a resta from question 8. Again, Sizzler and Chuck-A-Rama ranked closely with 36% and 34%, respectively, in tern service. (See following graph \"Service\") Questions 14, 21, 28: Compared to the other attributes, annosphere not given as much importance by the respondents , selecting a restaurant. However, Sizzler ranked fairly hil this area when compared to Chuck-A-Rama while both Cl A-Rama and Sizzler ranked extremely high compare Ponderosa. Sizzler was ranked excellent by 36%; Chue Rama was ranked excellent by 28%. 8 Detailed Findings Ouestion 29: This question asked respondents how likely they were to eat at Chuck-A-Rama in the future. Forty-nine percent of the respondents said they probably will return to Chuck-A-Rama in the future while 4% said they were unsure. Six percent of the respondents said they would not return to Chuck-A-Rama. Ouestion 31: This question asked the respondents to detennine which restaurant was the best value when comparing all four attributes (price, quality of food, service, and atmosphere). Thirty-seven percent rated Chuck-A-Rama as the best value overall. The main reasons given for Chuck-A-Rama being the best value are variety and price. After analyzing the data, it is obvious that Sizzler and Ponderosa are ranked- high in some areas and low in others while Chuck-A-Rama seems to remain fairly consistent in their ratings which would explain the reason most people feel that they are the best value overall. 9 Detailed Findings Questions 33-38: These questions deal with advertising. Sizzler and Ponderosa ranked fairly high in advertisement recognition when compared to Chuck-A-Rama. Nearly half of the respondents had seen a TV advertisement for Sizzler and Ponderosa while only 25% remembered seeing a television ad for Chuck-ARama. However, the data can be misleading when measunng effectiveness. For example, most people had a negative perception of Ponderosa's television advertisements and only remembered seeing John Prince promoting the grand buffet. 10 .----CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Cwhhuenckc-Ao-Rama I.S the best overall value with 38% of the respooden ts area. mpared to other buffet-style restaurants in the PIOvo/O reJl1 Tcohme pmaraedjon'ty of the people surveyed preferred foreign restaU\"\"\"\" type of r to other types of restaurants. 1be second wost preferred restauran estaurant are the western styles restaUrants Buffet style ts are rated third in attendance.

We are grateful for the opportunity to gain \"hands on\" experience in marketing research. We are pleased to provide you with this hard bound report containing the objectives, methodology, findings, conclusions, and recommendations of our study for Chuck-ARama's Provo and Orem restaurants. We hope that the information herein will provide you with a base to make future marketing decisions for Chuck-A-Rama. Sincerely, Big West Marketing Aaron Cobabe Brendan Snow Betty Ward Scott Hales Executive Summary EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Chuck-A-Rama is a buffet-style restaurant offering a large selection of food including a salad bar, a dessert bar, and a hot food bar containing several entrees. Chuck-A-Rama's corporate headquarters is located in Salt Lake City with restaurants in Provo, Orem, Salt Lake City, and Ogden. Chuck-A-Rama's Executive Vice-President, Mike Johanson, has asked Big West Marketing to conduct a marketing research project for the Provo and Orem Chuck-ARama restaurants. The purpose of this study is to provide Chuck-A-Rama information on Provo/Orem area residents perception of Chuck-A-Rama and of buffet style restaurants in general. Also, the project includes findings on how effective Chuck-a-Rama's advertising has been in reaching potential customers. RESEARCH QUESTIONS What is the public's attitude towards buffet-style restaurants in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service? What is the public's perception of Chuck-A-Rama in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service and how does it compare to other restaurants in the Provo/Orem area (including Sizzler and Ponderosa)? What types of media have been most effective in increasing community patronage of Chuck-A-Rama? METHODOLOGY Two focus groups were conducted to determine specific perceptions about Chuck-A-Rama in terms of quality, atmosphere, price, and service. From the information discussed in the focus groups, a telephone questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was randomly administered to 300 respondents. Exploratory and secondary research was conducted; however, the information gathered was inappropriate for application to the Chuck-A-Rama study. Executive Summary CONCLUSIONS Chuck-A-Rama is the best overall value when compared to Sizzler and Ponderosa. The majority of restaurant customers in Provo and Orem frequent foreign food restaurants. Quality of Food and Service are the most important attributes in selecting a restaurant. Nearly half of those people surveyed had not seen any type of advertising for Chuck-A-Rama. Lack of quality food and good service are the main reasons people do not like buffet-style restaurants. Executive Summary RECOMMENDATIONS Use television advertisements for awareness and promotions Create menu awareness Provide hostesses to direct customers in \"proper procedures\" Tipping Make Chuck-A-Rama affordable for families Create a Salad bar only option Control noise levels Create a private area for banquets and conferences Limitations LIMITATIONS Big West Marketing carefully followed the proposed methodology in order to gather data with as little error as possible. However, some unavoidable limitations do exist. The following paragraphs outline these possible errors. Sampling Error The telephone survey was gathered through a representative sampling of Provo/Orem area residents. The survey was administered to 291 people from which inferences are made to the entire population. Because this was a survey and not a census, some sampling error does exist. Response Error After completing the survey and analyzing the data, the research team found that some respondents answers appeared to give inaccurate information. There are several reasons that respondents give erroneous information. They include the following reasons: Respondents do not take the study seriously Respondents want to impress the interviewers Respondents are embarrassed, or do not want to respond Respondents do not understand the questions Respondents do not know, remember, or communicate requested information (Andrus, 103) Non-Response Error Although 291 people responded to the questionnaire, some people chose not to respond to certain questions. For example, several respondents felt uncomfortable giving their ages and income levels. Because of this factor, some questions will have fewer than 291 responses. Limitations Measurement Error Measurement errors exist when questions asked to respondents are ambiguous or the sequence of the questions influences the respondents answers. Also, interviewers can make mistakes by not following questionnaire instructions, inappropriately influencing respondents, or misrecording data.

APPENDIX A: PROPOSAL APPENDIX B: QUESTIONNAIRE APPENDIX C: FREQUENCIES APPENDIX D: CROSS TABS DETAILED FINDINGS Foeus Groups FOCUS GROUPS Focus groups are small groups of people who are brought together in a comfortable setting to informally discuss a research subject, under the guidance of a moderator. Focus groups use interaction to stimulate responses. They provide insights which are not possible with questionnaires. (Andrus, 139) Big West Marketing conducted two separate focus groups each consisting of five married couples. Six people were sent to the Provo restaurant and six were sent to the Orem restaurant. The participants had one week to attend Chuck-A-Rama with their spouses, and at the end of the week, all attended a focus group meeting with Big West Marketing. The two focus groups were held in the Tanner Building on BYV campus. The entire meeting was videod by Big West Marketing. Major Issues The major problems focus group participants discussed include the following: 1. No apparent signs or indications of clear procedures for the customer to follow 2. Poor labeling of foods and salad bar dressings 3. Lack of an exclusive salad bar offer 4. Pricing high for a large family with lots of kids Instructions Many of the participants felt they needed better instructions on how to \"eat\" at Chu,ck-A-Rama. For example, they didn't know whether to seat themselves or be seated. They wondered if they should get their own drink, Foeus Groups or wait for a waiter/waitress to bring it to them. Should the customer get a new plate each time he/she goes back for more food? Are tips appropriate? And if so, for the service rendered, what tips are expected? And, how does one know that a table is already taken? All these honest questions may encourage Chuck-A-Rama to reevaluate its signing and instructions given to the customer. Labeling The focus groups came to a consensus that some of the items like salad dressing need to be marked (or if marked, marked more clearly) to help the customer know what is what. Salad Bar Several of the focus group participants expressed a positive perception of Chuck-A-Rama's salad bar. They wish that Chuck-A-Rama would offer some kind of a \"salad bar option\", in which they could eat exclusively from the salad bar at a lower cost. Pricing Many of the participants who have large families expressed a concern about the pricing of Chuck-A-Rama. They said that it is just too expensive to take the whole family to Chuck-A-Rama, especially when the small kids eat so little. Other Issues Many comments were made by individuals in the focus groups. The following were individual perceptions, ideas, frustrations, and opinions expressed to Big West Marketing: 2 FDeus Groups Negative Price might be a little high for younger families. Give customers a menu so they know what food is being served. Parking lot in Orem is always full - hard to find a place to park. Difficult to access the Orem restaurant. Hard to cross the street. Have a night for families - special prices. Better prices for children $3.00 too much for a 6 year old Wanted more breads. Ice Cream tasted like powdered milk. Didn't like the chicken. Desserts all tasted the same. Some of the dishes were dirty and spotted. Not much recognition of advertising. Provide a box of gloves for handling the serving spoon. Didn't like Using the same spoon someone else used. Didn't know what to do when they got there. Did not like the name Chuck-A-Rama. Their impressions were: 1. Reminded them of wagon wheels. Give a bad image. 2. Everything seems to have the name ARAMA. 3. you just go there to stuff yourself. 4. Dark, Brown, and Orange restaurant that has poor food. One person would not return because he didn't want to have all you can eat. He didn't believe that you should stuff yourself. Very well decorated with light colors. Several loved the salad bar and would go just for the salad if they didn't have to pay $7.00 just for a salad. Offer just salad for a lower price. Price seemed good. Liked Chuck-A-Rama more than the competition. Never treated bad at Chuck-A-Rama. They wouldn't return if service was bad. Dessert bar very popular to families with children. Good service. Liked deserts in small servings. Well done. S year old loves all you can eat desserts. 3 FDeus Groups Positive ....., Food stayed fresh and hot because it was usedi. Fruit bar was very good. A lot of good vegetables. Bathrooms were clean and family oriented with changing tables. Restaurant has a happy light atmosphere. Clean restrooms. Very nice displays Salad bar was very nice looking and bright, seemed to stand out. Liked food on different bars or serving areas. Very good muffins. Provo restaurant more light and open than the Orem restaurant. 5 Detailed Findings DETAILED FINDINGS Question 1: What restaurant do you visit most often? At the beginning of the survey, the respondents were introduced to the survey with a question about which restaurant they frequent most often. The individual restaurants were classified into the following categories: Fast Food: Foreign Food: Western Food: Sizzler Ponderosa Chuck-A-Rama Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, etc. Olive Garden, Los Hermanos, China Bowl, etc. Prestwich Farms, Tony Romas, Magelbys, etc. Eleven percent of the respondents' said that Chuck-A-Rama was the restaurant they visited most often. Sizzler and Ponderosa scored considerably lower with 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively. (See following graph \"Which Restaurant do you visit most often\") Foreign foods was ranked highest I Question 2 and Question 3: Do you like buffet-style restaurants and why? Approximately seventy-five percent of the respondents said they like buffet-style restaurants and fifty percent of those liked buffets because of the variety of food. Low quality of food was the main reason 25% percent of the respondents did not like buffet-style restaurants. (See following three graphs \"Do you like buffets, why like buffets, why dislike buffets) 5 Detailed Fina Question 4: Thi i a filter question designed to allow only those pe with recent experiences at buffet-style restaurants to COID] the entire questionnaire. Question 5 through 8: These questions were asked to determine the ov importance of price, quality of food, atmosphere, and selVi, cu tomers selection of a restaurant. All the attributes v, from omewhat to very important to most customers, hOWl eventy percent of the respondents said that quality of food VERY important. (See following graph \"How important 2 6 Detailed Findings Questions 11, 18, 25: These questions compared Sizzler, Ponderosa, and Chuck-A-Rama in terms of price. Chuck-A-Rama was stronger than the other two restaurants in this area. Thirty-six percent of the respondents rated Chuck-A-Rama excellent in tenns of price. Ponderosa was rated excellent in tenns of price by 14% of the respondents. Only twelve percent of the respondents rated Sizzler excellent in price. Sizzler's highest rating in terms of price was in the fair category with 39% of the respondents. (See following graph \"Price\") Questions 12, 19, 26: The quality of food was discussed in these questions. Again, Chuck-A-Rama received the highest rating in terms of quality of food with 36% of the respondents listing them as excellent. Sizzler was extremely close with 35% of the respondents listing them as excellent in tenns of quality of food. Ponderosa received an excellent rating from only 10% of the respondents. (See following graph \"Quality\") 7 Detailed Fin. Questions 13, 20, 27: The next attribute, service, was ra comparatively high in the respondents selection of a resta from question 8. Again, Sizzler and Chuck-A-Rama ranked closely with 36% and 34%, respectively, in tern service. (See following graph \"Service\") Questions 14, 21, 28: Compared to the other attributes, annosphere not given as much importance by the respondents , selecting a restaurant. However, Sizzler ranked fairly hil this area when compared to Chuck-A-Rama while both Cl A-Rama and Sizzler ranked extremely high compare Ponderosa. Sizzler was ranked excellent by 36%; Chue Rama was ranked excellent by 28%. 8 Detailed Findings Ouestion 29: This question asked respondents how likely they were to eat at Chuck-A-Rama in the future. Forty-nine percent of the respondents said they probably will return to Chuck-A-Rama in the future while 4% said they were unsure. Six percent of the respondents said they would not return to Chuck-A-Rama. Ouestion 31: This question asked the respondents to detennine which restaurant was the best value when comparing all four attributes (price, quality of food, service, and atmosphere). Thirty-seven percent rated Chuck-A-Rama as the best value overall. The main reasons given for Chuck-A-Rama being the best value are variety and price. After analyzing the data, it is obvious that Sizzler and Ponderosa are ranked- high in some areas and low in others while Chuck-A-Rama seems to remain fairly consistent in their ratings which would explain the reason most people feel that they are the best value overall. 9 Detailed Findings Questions 33-38: These questions deal with advertising. Sizzler and Ponderosa ranked fairly high in advertisement recognition when compared to Chuck-A-Rama. Nearly half of the respondents had seen a TV advertisement for Sizzler and Ponderosa while only 25% remembered seeing a television ad for Chuck-ARama. However, the data can be misleading when measunng effectiveness. For example, most people had a negative perception of Ponderosa's television advertisements and only remembered seeing John Prince promoting the grand buffet. 10 .- - -- CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Cwhhuenckc-Ao-Rama I.S the best overall value with 38% of the respooden ts area. mpared to other buffet-style restaurants in the PIOvo/O reJl1 Tcohme pmaraedjon'ty of the people surveyed preferred foreign restaU\"\"\"\" type of r to other types of restaurants. 1be second wost preferred restauran estaurant are the western styles restaUrants Buffet style ts are rated third in attendance.
